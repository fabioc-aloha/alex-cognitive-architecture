# Heir Skill Promotion Protocol

> How skills evolve from heir projects to Master Alex

**Related**: bootstrap-learning (heir expertise development), global-knowledge skill (promotion patterns), skill-building skill (creation methodology), heir-project-improvement (trifecta + research-first), adversarial-oversight (Validator review gate)

---

## Quick Reference: Promotion Patterns

See [global-knowledge skill](../skills/global-knowledge/SKILL.md#promotion-candidate-patterns) for detailed patterns. Quick summary:

| Strong Signals                            | Anti-Signals             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Cross-project applicability (3+ projects) | Project-specific config  |
| Resolution pattern with solution          | Temporary workarounds    |
| Hard-won gotchas                          | Personal preferences     |
| Architecture with rationale               | Incomplete/draft content |
| Pipeline/workflow patterns                | Already exists in Master |
| Integration patterns                      | Too specific names/IDs   |

**Auto-promotion score ≥ 5**: frontmatter (+3), structure (+2), tags (+1), content size (+1-3), code examples (+2), general terms (+1-3)

---

## When to Use

- Heir completes a real-world project with domain expertise
- Knowledge is generalizable beyond the specific project
- Skill doesn't already exist in Master Alex

---

## The Promotion Workflow

### 1. Let Heirs Experiment First

- Heirs learn by **doing**, not reading specs
- Real projects create battle-tested knowledge
- Edge cases discovered through actual use

### 2. Ship Before Documenting

> A skill written after successful delivery is worth 10x one written from theory.

**Wait for:**

- Project completion or major milestone
- Real-world validation (published, deployed, shipped)
- Gotchas and fixes discovered

### 3. Heir Creates the Skill

Ask the heir:

```
Look at `.github/skills/markdown-mermaid/SKILL.md` as a reference.
Create a similar skill for [domain] in `.github/skills/[skill-name]/`.
Include the gotchas you discovered.
```

### 4. Master Reviews

- Is it generalizable beyond this project?
- Are the patterns reusable?
- Does it overlap with existing skills?

### 4.5. Quality Gate (Promotion Readiness Score)

Calculate before promoting:

| Criterion                                 | Points |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Has applyTo frontmatter                   | +2     |
| Has complete frontmatter (applyTo + description) | +3 |
| Has Troubleshooting section               | +2     |
| Has code examples                         | +2     |
| Content > 100 lines                       | +1     |
| Content > 200 lines                       | +2     |
| Uses generic terms (not project-specific) | +1-3   |
| Has Activation Patterns table             | +1     |

**Score thresholds:**

- **≥12**: Ready for Master promotion
- **8-11**: Needs refinement — add missing sections
- **<8**: Keep developing in heir

**Consolidation check**: If related skills exist in Master, merge rather than add.

### 4.7. Trifecta Completeness Check

Before promoting, assess whether the capability is a trifecta candidate:

| Question                                                               | Answer                          | Implication                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Was this a trifecta in the heir? (skill + instruction + prompt)        | Yes → promote all three         | No → promote skill only    |
| Does the heir instruction contain platform-specific steps?             | Yes → adapt or skip instruction | No → promote as-is         |
| Is the capability user-invocable in Master context?                    | Yes → promote the prompt        | No → skip prompt           |
| Does it pass the heir Why Test? (see `trifecta-audit.instructions.md`) | Yes → trifecta candidate        | No → single-file promotion |

**Rule**: Never promote a trifecta partially. Either all applicable components promote, or document why some were excluded.

### 5. Propose or Promote to Master

**For Heirs (Lightweight Workflow)**: Use `Alex: Propose Skill to Global Knowledge` command

- One-click workflow packages skill with YAML v2 frontmatter
- Auto-validates skill (promotion readiness score 0-12)
- Generates GitHub PR description
- Copies skill to temp folder ready for manual PR
- **Time**: <5 minutes from command to PR creation

**Option A (Manual)**: Copy skill folder from heir to Master's `.github/skills/`

**Option B (Prompt)**: Use the promote prompt to interactively promote a skill to global knowledge

### 6. Update Master's Catalog

- Add to `copilot-instructions.md` skill list
- Run `node .github/muscles/brain-qa.cjs` to validate updated skill inventory

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't                          | ✅ Do Instead                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Write skill before project starts | Let real work inform the skill     |
| Copy half-baked learnings         | Wait for validated knowledge       |
| Duplicate existing skills         | Extend or merge with existing      |
| Skip the review step              | Master validates before absorption |

---

## Example: AlexCook → rich-document-pdf

1. ✅ Heir built cookbook with MD/emoji/SVG → PDF pipeline
2. ⏳ Heir finalizing scripts for Amazon KDP publication
3. 🔜 After ship: heir creates `.github/skills/rich-document-pdf/SKILL.md`
4. 🔜 Master reviews and promotes

---

## Upgrade Preservation (Automatic)

When heirs upgrade to a new Alex version, their skills are **automatically preserved**:

### What Happens During Upgrade

1. **Backup**: All existing `.github/` content backed up with timestamp
2. **Fresh Install**: New Alex architecture deployed
3. **Auto-Restore**: Profile, episodic memories, AND user-created skills restored
4. **Frontmatter Normalization**: Legacy formats upgraded to current schema

### Schema Migrations (Automatic)

| Legacy Format        | Current Format                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `## Synapses`        | (removed - use frontmatter)   |
| `synapses.json`      | (removed - use semantic search) |
| `context: "..."`     | `when: "..." + yields: "..."` |
| `activationKeywords` | `activationContexts`          |

### Philosophy

> **Never lose heir-created work.** Skills represent hard-won expertise from real projects. The upgrade process auto-restores everything recommended; only stale items (>90 days) require manual review.

## Reverse Flow: Wishlist Fulfillment

> How Master Alex fulfills wishlist items and distributes to heirs

### The Wishlist Feedback Loop

```
┌─────────────┐  signals   ┌──────────────────┐  fulfills  ┌─────────────────┐
│    Heirs    │──────────▶│    Wishlist      │───────────▶│   Master Alex   │
│ (projects)  │           │ skill-registry   │            │ creates skill   │
└─────────────┘           └──────────────────┘            └────────┬────────┘
       ▲                                                          │
       │                   ┌──────────────────┐                   │
       └───────────────────│ Global Knowledge │◀──────────────────┘
            pulls          │ skills/          │     pushes
                           └──────────────────┘
```

### When Master Fulfills Wishlist

1. **Review requests** in heir project issues or AI-Memory/notes.md
2. **Create skill** in Master's `.github/skills/{skill-name}/`
3. **Heir sync** happens automatically during extension packaging
4. **Log** the fulfillment in AI-Memory/notes.md
5. **Commit** Master Alex

### Wishlist Item Lifecycle

| Status             | Location                           | Meaning                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Pending**        | `wishlist.items[]`                 | Skill requested but not yet built       |
| **Fulfilled**      | `recentlyFulfilled[]` + `skills[]` | Skill built and available               |
| **Already exists** | `fulfilledBy` field                | Wishlist item covered by existing skill |

### Example: February 2026 Batch

```json
{
  "recentlyFulfilled": [
    {
      "id": "multi-agent-orchestration",
      "fulfilledBy": "multi-agent-orchestration",
      "fulfilledDate": "2026-02-11"
    },
    {
      "id": "observability-monitoring",
      "fulfilledBy": "observability-monitoring",
      "fulfilledDate": "2026-02-11"
    },
    {
      "id": "database-design",
      "fulfilledBy": "database-design",
      "fulfilledDate": "2026-02-11"
    },
    {
      "id": "performance-profiling",
      "fulfilledBy": "performance-profiling",
      "fulfilledDate": "2026-02-11"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Heir Discovery

Heirs detect new skills via:

- Extension sync from Master .github/skills/
- Project type matching against `projectSignals`

**Cross-platform insights**: Notable skill patterns are also captured in AI-Memory/global-knowledge.md for access from M365 Copilot and other surfaces.

---

## Extension Commands: Skill Inheritance

### `Alex: Inherit Skill from Global Knowledge`

Manual process for heirs to pull skills from Master Alex:

1. Check available inheritable skills in Master's .github/skills/
2. Copy skill trifecta (instruction + skill + prompt) to the heir project
3. Add `inheritedFrom` field in SKILL.md frontmatter for lineage tracking

**Features**:

- Only `inheritance: "inheritable"` skills are eligible
- `inheritedFrom` tracking in frontmatter prevents drift
- Master Alex protection warning (kill switch aware)

**Note**: The legacy GitHub-based Global Knowledge repo (Alex-Global-Knowledge/) has been replaced by the AI-Memory OneDrive folder for cross-platform knowledge and Master .github/skills/ as the canonical skill source.
