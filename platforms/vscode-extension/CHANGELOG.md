## [8.3.3] - 2026-04-25

### Heir Feedback Sweep

Processed 9 feedback items submitted by heir projects (`fabioc-aloha`, `alexbooks`, `aloha`, `health`) via `AI-Memory/feedback/`. All items resolved and feedback queue cleared.

### Added

- **Skill `book-launch-content`**: New skill capturing the "dogfood the book's thesis on its own manuscript" pattern observed in AlexBooks. Includes inventory step, 4-pattern catalog, 6-beat launch-post structure, anti-patterns, and checklist.
- **Frontmatter Pre-Write Gate** in `skill-building` and `skill-creator` skills: required-fields table per artifact type is now enforced at authoring time, not at next `/dream`. Resolves the recurring "skill written → brain-qa fails later" pattern reported 3 times in 60 days.
- **Meditation 5th R — Resolve**: Added explicit close step (Review → Relate → Reinforce → Record → **Resolve**). Resolve summarizes persisted artifacts, evaluates dream chaining criteria, and emits a one-line session summary so meditations no longer end ambiguously.
- **Episodic Memory section** in `meditation/SKILL.md`: clarifies when to write `.github/episodic/meditation-YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}.md` vs `/memories/session/`, with file-naming conventions.
- **User Section Token Budget** in `identity-customization.instructions.md`: explicit rule that the `## User` section in `copilot-instructions.md` carries name + preferences only; all other identity fields live in `AI-Memory/user-profile.json`.

### Fixed

- **Heir-aware `verifyProject`**: `--mode Verify` previously compared heir file counts against Master's full inventory, producing guaranteed false failures (heirs intentionally receive a filtered subset). Verify now detects Master via `isProtectedProject()` and applies a structural check to heirs (folder exists, non-empty) instead of strict file counts.
- **Markdown preview styling for heirs**: Added `"markdown.styles": [".github/config/markdown-light.css"]` to `ESSENTIAL_SETTINGS`. Heirs now get the brain's preview styling on next upgrade via additive merge (existing user settings preserved).
- **Heir fallback for missing `dream-report.json`**: Meditation skill now treats a missing dream report as never-dreamed (overdue).
- **Heir fallback for missing welcome configs**: Welcome Experience Check skips when `taglines.json` or `loop-menu.json` does not exist.

### Changed

- `.github/skills/meditation/SKILL.md` renamed framework from "4 R's" to "5 R's" with the new Resolve step.

### Notes

- `EXTERNAL-API-REGISTRY.md` auto-preservation (requested by AlexBooks heir) was already implemented in v8.3.2; confirmed and closed.
- v8.3.0 Phase 1 NORTH-STAR/copilot-instructions overwrite bug (reported by AlexBooks heir) was already fixed in v8.3.1; confirmed and closed.

---

## [8.3.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed

- **Welcome panel: force Setup as landing tab**: `WelcomeViewProvider.ts` no longer restores the persisted `activeTab` on panel open. Heirs reported the Welcome menu crashing / failing to render on the Loop tab; forcing Setup on every open guarantees initialize/upgrade actions remain reachable. In-session clicks still persist so the chosen tab survives panel re-renders within the same session.
- **Welcome panel: Safe Mode fallback**: every data source (`healthPulse`, `tagline`, `activePackage`, loop groups) is wrapped in try/catch with a typed fallback. If `getHtml()` throws, the panel now renders a minimal CSP-locked Setup view with Initialize, Upgrade, Show Diagnostics, and Retry buttons instead of a blank webview.
- **Brain upgrade: preserve `EXTERNAL-API-REGISTRY.md`**: both executors (shared core and `bootstrap.ts`) now save the pre-upgrade registry as `EXTERNAL-API-REGISTRY.backup.md` for Phase 2 LLM curation.
- **Sync-to-heir: sanitize `brain-version.json`**: Master lock state (`upgradeLock`, `lockReason`, etc.) is stripped at the sync boundary so heirs don't inherit self-protection and silently skip fleet upgrades.

### Added

- **Diagnostics OutputChannel** + `alex.showDiagnostics` command: timestamped logger for activation and Welcome-view events, reachable from the command palette and Safe Mode recovery buttons.
- **Scan muscle**: new `NORTH_STAR_CUSTOM` and `API_REGISTRY_CUSTOM` findings so Phase 2 curation covers all three `.backup.md` files.

---

## [8.3.1] - 2026-04-23

### Beta — Upgrade Safety Hardening

Safety fixes for the brain-upgrade pipeline across all three executors (fleet script, VS Code extension, LLM-callable muscle). Personal beta release for internal fleet testing; no breaking changes.

### Added

- **Skip-if-up-to-date gate**: `upgradeProject` in the shared core now short-circuits when the installed `brain-version.json` `version` is ≥ the target. A new `--force` flag on both `scripts/upgrade-brain.cjs` and `.github/muscles/brain-upgrade.cjs` bypasses the gate for intentional reinstalls. Skipped projects never create a backup.
- **Semver helpers** in `brain-upgrade-core.cjs`: `parseSemver`, `compareSemver`, `readInstalledVersion` (dep-free).
- **Extension upgrade-lock support**: `bootstrap.ts` now honors `brain-version.json.upgradeLock`, `alex.workspace.protectedMode` setting, and the master kill-switch marker. Previously only the marker file was checked.
- **Extension semver gate**: `bootstrap.ts` now uses `>=` comparison (was strict `!==`), preventing accidental downgrades when running an older VSIX against a newer installed brain.
- **Heir identity preservation in extension**: `bootstrap.ts` now captures `identity`, `upgradeLock`, `lockReason` from the pre-upgrade `brain-version.json` and re-applies them after install. Previously these fields were overwritten on every upgrade.
- **CI backup in extension**: `bootstrap.ts` now saves the pre-upgrade `copilot-instructions.md` as `copilot-instructions.backup.md` for Phase 2 reconciliation. Matches the shared core's behavior.
- **NORTH-STAR backup for LLM curation**: Both the shared core and the extension now save the pre-upgrade `NORTH-STAR.md` as `NORTH-STAR.backup.md`. NORTH-STAR is a semantic document — unlike config files (mechanically preserved), the LLM decides in Phase 2 whether to keep, merge, or relocate it (the old copy may have been placed in the wrong directory). The fresh template is installed as the active `NORTH-STAR.md`. Skill documents the curation decision tree.
- **Release preflight parity check**: New check in `scripts/release-preflight.cjs` fails when `BRAIN_SUBDIRS` or `BRAIN_ROOT_FILES` drift between `bootstrap.ts` (TS) and `brain-upgrade-core.cjs` (CJS shared core). Caught real drift (missing `brain-version.json` in the TS array) on its first run.
- **Report → Validate → Approve ritual**: New `/propose-change` prompt and `master-wiki/decisions/change-proposals/` archive for non-trivial refactors. Template + README + first worked example (`brain-upgrade-v8.3/`). Documented as a pattern in `learned-patterns.instructions.md`.
- **Test coverage**: 3 new tests for skip-when-equal, force-bypasses-skip, and `compareSemver` ordering. Total 174/174 green (was 171).

### Changed

- **NORTH-STAR is now LLM-curated, not mechanically preserved**: Previously the shared core copied the heir's `NORTH-STAR.md` from backup back into place on every upgrade. It is now removed from `HEIR_MANAGED_ROOT_FILES` and flows through Phase 2 LLM reconciliation instead (saved as `NORTH-STAR.backup.md`). This also handles cases where the old file was in the wrong directory.
- **Brain-upgrade trifecta refactor**: Three executors (fleet script, extension bootstrap, muscle CLI) now share one Phase 1 mechanical contract via `.github/muscles/shared/brain-upgrade-core.cjs`. The extension mirrors the shared core in TypeScript because CJS can't be imported cross-boundary; the preflight parity check prevents silent drift.
- **Trifecta self-protection**: Four paths are now protected from backup-restore to prevent a half-applied trifecta refactor from being overwritten by its predecessor: `.github/skills/brain-upgrade/SKILL.md`, `.github/instructions/brain-upgrade.instructions.md`, `.github/muscles/brain-upgrade.cjs`, `.github/muscles/shared/brain-upgrade-core.cjs`.
- **Authoritative version stamp**: `brain-version.json` is the single source of truth. Legacy `.alex-brain-version` is no longer written and is removed on upgrade (preserved in backup for rollback).
- **Welcome panel defaults to Setup tab**: Stale persisted tab state (from a deleted tab in a prior version) no longer produces a blank panel. Source-level fix; dist rebuild happens at next publish.

### Fixed

- **Self-contained check**: Removed master-only relative path references in the brain-upgrade trifecta docs (replaced with plain code spans) so the doc works identically in master and heirs.

### Known Limitations

- The extension does not yet preserve heir-managed config files (`loop-menu.json`, `taglines.json`, `markdown-light.css`). Use `scripts/upgrade-brain.cjs` or the CLI muscle for heirs where this matters. Tracked for full parity port.

## [8.3.0] - 2026-04-22

### Quality Release

Pure quality release — zero new features. All effort on correctness, performance, documentation accuracy, and developer experience.

### Changed

- **Extension architecture**: Decomposed 2 god files — `WelcomeViewProvider` (1,400→725 lines) via message router extraction + CSS externalization; `scheduledTasks` (1,480→53-line barrel) into 5 focused modules (taskStore, workflowGenerator, taskDispatcher, scheduledTasksUI, types)
- **Performance**: Consolidated 4 always-on instructions → 2 (epistemic-calibration, proactive-awareness absorptions), saving ~701 tokens/request. Trimmed 2 largest skills (-296 lines)
- **11 extension settings**: Muscle timeout/buffer, status bar refresh, autopilot intervals, dream thresholds, sync stale days, metrics retention — all previously hardcoded
- **Release script ordering**: Publish to marketplace BEFORE git commit/tag/push (irreversible ops after validation)
- **Preflight gates**: VSIX version mismatch and missing CHANGELOG entry promoted from WARN to FAIL
- **VS Code engine**: Minimum raised to 1.117.0

### Fixed

- **19 broken cross-references** from v8.x modernization (deleted/renamed muscles, skills, instructions)
- **342 stale currency stamps** updated after structural and content review
- **Wiki accuracy**: 34 issues across 10 heir wiki pages — stale counts, removed Autopilot tab references, corrected Initialize flow description, replaced nonexistent settings
- **Architecture docs**: Updated counts, version refs, and engine requirements across 6 master wiki files + both READMEs
- **Heir sync consistency**: Reconciled BRAIN_SUBDIRS (added hooks), aligned BRAIN_ROOT_FILES, removed master-only hooks.json from sync

### Added

- **Test suite**: 152 node:test + 163 vitest = 315 tests (was 5 vitest tests pre-v8.3.0)
- **CI workflow**: `brain-qa.yml` runs npm test + brain-qa + self-contained checks on push/PR
- **10 new test files**: htmlUtils, muscleRunner, bootstrap, scheduledTasks, messageRouter, sync-brain-files, upgrade-brain, publish-heir, release-preflight, converter-qa
- **Message router**: Typed route table replacing 28-case switch statement

---

## [8.2.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Brain Ops loop group**: 6-button sidebar group (Sync to Heir, Publish Heir, Fleet Audit, Brain QA, Upgrade Heirs, Release)
- **Rituals loop group**: 3-button sidebar group (Meditate, Dream, Self-Assess) with thematic icons
- **Tagline expansion**: 18 → 25 taglines including architecture, collaboration, and project identity themes
- **Welcome-experience-customization trifecta**: New skill + instruction + prompt for guided welcome customization

### Changed

- **Customize Welcome button**: Label changed to "Customize for This Project" for clarity

---

## [8.2.2] - 2026-04-22

### Security

- **Shell injection fix**: `runMuscleInTerminal` now escapes backslashes and double quotes in arguments to prevent shell metacharacter injection
- **Token exposure fix**: `setupCopilotPAT` pipes the GitHub token via stdin instead of passing it as a `--body` CLI argument (no longer visible in process list)

### Fixed

- **Error code handling**: `runMuscle` now handles string error codes (`ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER`) and signal kills (`SIGTERM`/`SIGKILL`) instead of silently returning exit code 1
- **Followup provider**: Chat followup no longer suggests `/autopilot list` (Autopilot is disabled); now suggests brain health check

---

## [8.2.1] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Backup on brain upgrade**: `bootstrapBrainFiles` now creates `.github-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` before overwriting brain dirs (upgrade only, not fresh install)
- **Upgrade UX**: `alex.upgrade` shows current vs target version, confirms before proceeding, skips if already up to date
- **Dream command title**: Renamed from "Run Dream Protocol" to "Brain Health Check & Fix" to match actual behavior
- **Converter file validation**: Converter commands now validate file extension before running — shows warning if wrong file type

---

## [8.2.0] - 2026-04-22

---

## [8.0.3] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Run Now button**: Autopilot task cards now have a 🚀 button that opens the GitHub Actions workflow dispatch page — run tasks in the cloud on demand, same as the scheduled execution.
- **Last-run tracking**: Each Autopilot task displays when it was last executed. Timestamps persist in `.github/config/.scheduled-tasks-state.json` and survive extension reloads.
- **Toggle as pause/resume**: Enabled tasks show a pause button; disabled tasks show a resume button — clearer intent than a generic toggle.

### Changed

- **Brand-aligned UI across all three tabs**: Every color in the sidebar now uses the Alex brand palette — Indigo 500 (`#6366f1`) as the primary accent, with brand green (`#22c55e`), yellow (`#eab308`), red (`#ef4444`), and blue (`#3b82f6`) for semantic indicators.
- **Autopilot card redesign**: Status pills (Active/Paused) replace status dots; action buttons grouped at card bottom with semantic hover colors (green for run/resume, orange for pause, red for delete); hover box-shadow on cards; mode icons tint indigo when active; description line-clamped to 2 lines.
- **Loop tab polish**: "Chat with Alex" CTA button uses brand indigo instead of VS Code default blue; Health Pulse status dot, nudge, and action button colors aligned to brand palette; expanded groups tint their icon to indigo; button hover shows subtle indigo left-border indicator.
- **Setup tab polish**: Same group and button polish as Loop — consistent indigo accent, expanded icon tint, and button hover indicators across all six groups.
- **Active tab indicator**: Selected tab now has a subtle indigo background tint in addition to the bottom border.
- **Accent-tinted scrollbar**: Sidebar scrollbar uses indigo-tinted track for brand cohesion.

---

## [8.0.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Sidebar UI polish**: Design tokens, 44px touch targets for accessibility, vertical button stacking, visible backgrounds and borders on task buttons. Multiple iterations to restore Autopilot card clarity — readable schedules, consistent descriptions.
- **Learn section URLs**: Corrected broken links and added `learnai` domain to URL allowlist in sidebar.
- **Empty autopilot on fresh heirs**: Heirs now ship with empty autopilot task list instead of erroring.
- **Sync exclusions**: `visual-memory/`, `audio-memory/`, and `examples/` subdirectories excluded from heir brain sync — reduces heir payload size.
- **upgrade-brain version detection**: Reads version from `package.json` instead of hardcoded value.

### Added

- **News feed monitoring**: Autopilot task for competition and ecosystem news tracking with structured watch format.
- **Competition analysis**: Feature comparison matrix (16 capabilities × 9 tools), critical analysis with bias disclosure, unique differentiators table. Archived at `master-wiki/news-feed/competition/`.
- **RAI privacy audit**: `RAI-AUDIT-v8.1.0.md` — data flow analysis across 9 memory tiers, PII exposure assessment, behavioral profiling risks, and remediation roadmap.
- **v8.1.0 plan**: 12-lane parallel development plan (83 tasks) covering heir slim, AFCP leverage, proactive awareness, knowledge scoring, fleet intel, brain evolution, RAI safety, privacy governance, docs, autopilot v2, extension polish, and competition response.
- **Brain currency audit**: 22 core skills stamped with 2026-04-20 currency dates.
- **Blog posts #8-#11**: Four new posts with header images.
- **Heir wiki tutorials**: 5 new tutorials with hero images, LearnAI domain tutorials, sidebar links.
- **Documentation count sync**: Updated brain inventory counts (194 skills, 150 instructions, 64 prompts) across 8+ documentation surfaces.

### Changed

- **Sidebar modernization**: WelcomeViewProvider and scheduledTasks rewritten with design token system — CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, and typography. Autopilot task cards simplified from verbose badge layout to clean card format.

---

## [8.0.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **brain-qa.cjs crash on fresh heirs**: Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'skills')` when running `brain-qa.cjs` on heir projects without an existing `brain-health-grid.md`. The `readExistingSemValues()` function now returns the correct `{ semValues, staleValues }` structure when the grid file doesn't exist.

### Added

- **Signal-driven autopilot mechanism**: New two-phase pattern for heirs to consume external signals (search logs, analytics, feedback) in autopilots. Scheduled collector task queries signal source daily → writes `.github/signals/suggestions.json` → SessionStart hook reads local cache (fast, 5s timeout safe). Full implementation guide in `sidebar-customization` skill.
- **Markdown preview CSS**: Added `.github/config/markdown-light.css` — GitHub-flavored markdown preview theme that syncs to heirs. Heirs opt-in via `.vscode/settings.json` `markdown.styles` setting.
- **Sidebar customization trifecta**: New `sidebar-customization` skill + instruction + `customize-sidebar.prompt.md` teaches heirs how to customize Loop tab buttons (`loop-menu.json`) and Autopilot scheduled tasks (`scheduled-tasks.json`).
- **Editorial critical thinking guidance**: Added "Editorial Passes Require Critical Thinking" section to `academic-paper-drafting.instructions.md`. Complex style rules (APA7 verb tense, citation format) are judgment tasks, not pattern-matching — now documented with alternative hypotheses, evidence needed, and falsifiability checks.
- **Thesis/dissertation applyTo**: Expanded `academic-paper-drafting.instructions.md` to trigger on `**/*thesis*,**/*dissertation*` paths.
- **FAQ: Agent picker clarification**: Added FAQ entry explaining that VS Code Copilot's `@` agent dropdown is a built-in feature — not customizable via Alex. Clarified the difference between Loop tab buttons (customizable via `loop-menu.json`) and the agent picker.

### Changed

- **Documentation: Natural language first**: Revised Getting-Started, User-Manual, and FAQ to use natural language examples throughout. Moved `@alex` prefix and `/slash` command syntax to a new "Advanced Syntax" section at the end of the User Manual for power users.
- **Heir feedback channel tested**: First production use of `AI-Memory/feedback/` for heir-to-master escalations. Three issues reported and resolved within one session.

---

## [8.0.0] - 2026-04-19

### Major Release — Clean-Room Extension Rebuild

The extension has been completely rebuilt from scratch with a modern, maintainable architecture. Every line of TypeScript is new. The cognitive architecture has been modernized with consistent terminology and a trifecta-based design.

### Added

- **Health Pulse System**: Real-time brain health monitoring with status computation (healthy/attention/critical), connection health scoring, ritual tracking, and architecture inventory
- **3-Tab Sidebar**: Loop (creative workflow), Autopilot (scheduled maintenance), Setup (configuration) — data-driven, declarative button definitions
- **Creative Loop Integration**: Ideate → Plan → Build → Test → Release → Improve workflow in sidebar

- **Brain Health Grid** (`.github/quality/brain-health-grid.md`): Comprehensive quality tracking dashboard with instruction/skill/prompt scoring matrices, semantic review dates, and priority queue management
- **project-scaffolding anti-patterns**: 7 anti-pattern rows (empty README, 10+ quick start steps, no license, hardcoded paths, stale screenshots, nested labyrinths, copy-paste) plus 3 troubleshooting sections

### Changed

- **Cognitive architecture quality audit**: 23 core tier skills semantically reviewed and validated (anti-hallucination, appropriate-reliance, awareness, code-review, cognitive-load, debugging-patterns, dialog-engineering, doc-hygiene, error-recovery-patterns, frustration-recognition, git-workflow, lint-clean-markdown, memory-activation, north-star, persona-detection, proactive-assistance, refactoring-patterns, root-cause-analysis, security-review, silence-as-signal, testing-strategies, vscode-extension-patterns, brain-qa)

---

## [7.7.4] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Star emoji breaking skill index matching**: Removed `\u2b50` prefix from 9 entries in memory-activation index that caused brain-qa Phase 3 false errors
- **Brain-qa heir regex**: Hardened Phase 3 skill-index regex to tolerate optional prefixes before skill names
- **MCP server name**: Corrected `EnterpriseMCP` to `enterprise-mcp` (kebab-case) in docs

---

## [7.7.3] - 2026-04-12

### Removed

- **Local telemetry system**: Deleted `telemetry.ts` (~450 lines) and stripped all telemetry imports/calls from 11 source files — privacy claim "no telemetry" is now fully accurate
- **View Diagnostics command** (`alex.viewBetaTelemetry`): Replaced with direct "Report Issue" link to GitHub Issues
- **Telemetry panel HTML**: Reduced `commandsDeveloperHandlers.ts` from 325 to 42 lines

### Changed

- **README Features section**: Expanded from 6 items to 12, documenting all 73 commands, 10 developer tools, document conversion, environment setup, and secrets management

- **Status Quick Pick**: "Report Issue" opens GitHub Issues instead of removed diagnostics panel

---

## [7.7.2] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **5 broken Quick Settings toggles**: Removed non-existent setting keys (`chat.requestQueuing.enabled`, `github.copilot.chat.agent.thinkingTool`, `chat.tools.autoRun`, `chat.tools.fileSystem.autoApprove`, `chat.hooks.enabled`) that errored on toggle in VS Code 1.115.0
- **8 invalid setting keys** in Environment Setup wizard: replaced with correct VS Code 1.115.0 equivalents (`chat.agent.thinkingStyle`, `chat.tools.edits.autoApprove`, `chat.tools.todos.showWidget`, etc.)
- **Dead webview routing**: Cleaned stale command handlers in sidebar

### Added

- **Extension pack**: All 15 recommended extensions now auto-install via `extensionPack` (Copilot Chat, ESLint, PowerShell, DotENV, YAML, Mermaid, Markdown All-in-One, MarkdownLint, Python, Pylance, Jupyter, Azure MCP Server, Bicep, Docker, ShellCheck)
- **6 new verified settings**: `chat.newSession.defaultMode`, `github.copilot.chat.anthropic.thinking.budgetTokens` (32K max), `github.copilot.chat.agent.autoFix`, `chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents`, `chat.tools.terminal.backgroundNotifications`, `chat.tools.terminal.detachBackgroundProcesses`
- **Export to .env button**: Write stored API keys to a `.env` file for scripts and external tools

### Changed

- **Unified Environment Setup**: Merged "Optimize Settings" categories (Chat-Centric, Formatters, Cross-Platform) into the main settings category picker — one flow with 6 categories instead of two separate commands
- **Removed Manage Extensions button** from sidebar — extension pack handles auto-install; command still available via palette
- **Simplified Full Setup wizard**: Settings → MCP servers → account check → bootstrap (no more extension-check phase)

---

## [7.7.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **brain-qa.cjs heir false positives**: Phase 3 skill index regex simplified to `\|\s*SKILL\s*\|` (was brittle `.includes()`), Phase 15 removed `user-profile.json` from master-only list (heirs have it legitimately), Phase 30 expected muscles list corrected for heir context
- **Dangling synapse references**: 9 synapse files referenced 6 master-only instruction files removed in v7.7.0 — cleaned
- **Brain anatomy accuracy**: M1/Premotor shifted anterior to Central Sulcus (correct precentral gyrus), Corpus Callosum reshaped to proper C-arch (genu→body→splenium), cerebellar folia lines added
- **Dead UI item**: "Review Pull Request" Quick Actions palette entry had no dispatch handler — removed

### Added

- **Phase 35 self-containment validation** in brain-qa.cjs — detects heir synapse files referencing master-only instruction paths
- **3 new brain regions** in interactive brain anatomy: Corpus Callosum (Agents x7), Spinal Cord (Hooks x22), Hypothalamus (Config x14) — with SVG, JS details, Mermaid diagrams, and mapping/pathology tables
- docs/index.html and docs/alex-brain-anatomy.html updated with current architecture stats (161 skills, 85 instructions, 33 muscles, 63 prompts, 111 episodic, 7 agents, 22 hooks, 14 config)

### Removed

- **GitHub PR review / issue fetch feature** (`githubIntegration.ts`) — unused, `repo` scope auth prompt removed. Cognitive tier gate, welcome view, status quick pick, and context menu entries cleaned

---

## [7.7.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- **Agent-only mode**: Removed participant mode (@alex mentions, /command slash commands) — agent mode exclusively
- Dead code cascade cleanup from participant removal (73 files in initial sweep, 10 in follow-up)
- Token waste audit: added `applyTo` scoping to 19 instructions, trimmed 10 oversized instruction-skill overlaps (-396 lines)
- Init/upgrade audit: removed dead `UpgradeResult` type, cleaned sweep findings

### Removed

### Changed

- Research-first workflow updated with Phase 0.5 planning gate
- Global Knowledge walkthrough updated from Git-based repository to cloud-synced AI-Memory
- brain-qa.cjs and brain-qa.ps1 warnings resolved to 0 (ASCII regex, agent parsing, heir exclusions, known overlaps, AI-Memory cloud detection)

### Removed

- **3 dead scaffolding files** removed: `globalKnowledgeBanner.ts`, `globalKnowledgePatterns.ts`, `globalKnowledgeContent.ts` (unused since AI-Memory migration)
- **Dead exports** cleaned: `scaffoldGlobalKnowledgeRepo`, `LLMPersona`, `PersonaSignal`, `updateWorkingMemorySlots` re-exports; `MEMORY_FILE_PATTERNS`, `HEALTH_THRESHOLDS` constants
- Workspace `user-profile.json` removed (now lives in AI-Memory)

---

## [7.4.2] - 2026-04-09

### Added

---

## [7.4.1] - 2026-04-09

> **Post-Release Quality Sweep** -- 6-phase verification pass after v7.4.0: dead export removal, TTS reference cleanup, catalog audit, and user documentation audit across all user-facing content.

### Removed

- **39 dead exports** across 18 files -- functions exported but never imported elsewhere, identified via `lint-unused` analysis
- **Stale TTS/voice references** in 7 user-facing documents -- architecture diagrams, feature tables, settings references, and prose cleaned after voice mode removal

### Fixed

- **PRIVACY.md** -- Image generation provider corrected from "Azure OpenAI or OpenAI" to "Replicate" with direct privacy policy link
- **SECURITY.md** -- Removed "WSS" protocol claim (was Edge TTS WebSocket, no longer used)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** -- Dream command title corrected ("Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)" to "Alex: Dream"), synapse count 150+ to 800+, script conventions ".ps1" to ".cjs / .ps1"
- **docs/index.html** -- Skills count 125 to 160, "32 TTS Languages" stat replaced with "45 Complete Trifectas", "Voice" removed from Multimodal feature
- **VSCODE-BRAIN-INTEGRATION.md** -- 11 stale TTS/voice references removed (architecture diagram, feature tables, settings reference, external services, prose); instruction count 50+ to 81
- **Extension CHANGELOG** -- Added 4 missing version entries (7.1.3, 7.2.0, 7.3.0, 7.4.0); redacted internal codename from 6.8.4 entry
- **package.json walkthrough** -- "100+ skills" to "160 skills" in welcome step description

- **SKILLS-CATALOG.md** -- Skill count 159+ to 160, inheritable count 141 to 146
- **SKILL-CATALOG-GENERATED.md** -- Regenerated with current 160-skill inventory

---

## [7.4.0] - 2026-04-08

> **Multi-Agent Strategy Edition** -- 10 coordination features across 3 phases, adapted from AFCP and 1ES AI-First Dev Starter Pack research. Multi-pass refinement, structured unknowns, assignment lifecycle tracking, skill-based task routing, and correlation vectors.

### Added

- **Structured Unknowns store** (`config/unknowns.json`) -- 5-category taxonomy (information, interpretation, decision, authority, capability) with 4 lifecycle states (open, consulting, resolved, deferred); agents surface uncertainty instead of guessing; 50-entry rolling store
- **Assignment Lifecycle hook (H17 SubagentStop)** (`hooks/subagent-stop.cjs`) -- Records agent name, outcome (success/partial/failure/cancelled), completion timestamp, and correlation ID to `assignment-log.json` after every delegation; 200-entry rolling log with metadata-preserving writes
- **Correlation Vectors** (`hooks/subagent-context.cjs` enhanced) -- `req-{hex}` request IDs generated at delegation, appended to chain as `req.agent.operation`; propagated via H16 SubagentStart, reset on session start; stored in `config/correlation-vector.json`
- **Skill-Based Task Routing** (`alex.agent.md`) -- 3-tier routing: Tier 1 keyword table (6 agents x task signals), Tier 2 learned expertise (5+ observations, 30-day decay), Tier 3 fallback to Alex orchestrator
- **Scoped Knowledge Artifacts** (`alex-researcher.agent.md` + `config/knowledge-artifacts.json`) -- Confidence-scored (0-1) knowledge records with supersession chains, tags, and 100-entry store; pruning at >90 days + <0.5 confidence
- **Expertise Tracking** (`muscles/analyze-assignments.cjs`) -- Meditation-time delegation analysis: per-agent success rates, recency weighting (30-day window), declining performance detection, Tier 2 readiness checks
- **Mission Profiles** -- 5 behavioral presets as prompt files: `mission-release` (heightened quality gates), `mission-research` (breadth-first, cite sources), `mission-debug` (3+ hypotheses, binary search), `mission-review` (adversarial, pattern deviation), `mission-draft` (skip Validator, accept TODOs)
- **Multi-Agent Strategy document** (`MULTI-AGENT-STRATEGY.md`) -- Master strategy synthesizing AFCP fleet coordination and 1ES Starter Pack patterns into 10 features across 3 implementation phases

### Changed

- **Multi-Pass Refinement** (`alex.agent.md`, `alex-builder.agent.md`, `alex-validator.agent.md`) -- 4-pass protocol (Draft, Correctness, Clarity, Edge Cases to Excellence) with pass-specific focus tables, "stay in your lane" rule, and 2-pass shortcut for small tasks; Builder gets pass-specific guidance, Validator gets lens-focused review
- **Context Layering Protocol** (`alex.agent.md`) -- 3-layer context injection for delegations: Always (Active Context, North Star, safety imperatives), Relevant (domain skills, recent episodic, related synapses), Never (unrelated domain knowledge, other project context)
- **Triage Rules with Confidence Scoring** (`alex-validator.agent.md`) -- Severity x confidence action matrix: high-severity always blocks, medium-severity blocks at 70%+ confidence, low-severity informational only; security findings always escalated regardless of confidence
- **Delegation Verification** (`alex.agent.md`) -- Post-delegation spot-checks: re-read changed files, run `tsc` for TypeScript, verify no stale imports/dead code; trust-but-verify with intensity scaling by task risk
- **H16 SubagentStart enhanced** (`hooks/subagent-context.cjs`) -- Now generates and propagates correlation vectors alongside Active Context injection
- **SessionStart hook enhanced** (`hooks/session-start.cjs`) -- Resets correlation vector state on new sessions while preserving existing metadata keys
- **Setup wizard extracted** -- `setupEnvironment.ts` split into `setupEnvironment.settings.ts` (setting definitions) and `setupEnvironment.extensions.ts` (recommended extensions list) for easier maintenance
- **Setup wizard UX simplified** -- Replaced verbose JSON-in-modal confirmation with a short message and "Preview First" option; category QuickPick built dynamically from registry
- **Bootstrap offered in setup wizard** -- `offerBootstrapProject()` checks eligibility (initialized, not Master Alex, bootstrap incomplete) and offers to launch or resume the bootstrap wizard after settings are applied; runs after init, upgrade, and manual setup
- **Settings promoted to Essential** -- 7 settings moved from Recommended to Essential: `chat.useAgentSkills`, `chat.includeReferencedInstructions`, `github.copilot.chat.copilotMemory.enabled`, `github.copilot.chat.tools.memory.enabled`, `chat.hooks.enabled`, `chat.useCustomAgentHooks`, `chat.agent.enabled`
- **8 new settings added** -- `chat.mcp.assisted.nuget.enabled`, `chat.autopilot.enabled`, `chat.agent.todoList`, `chat.agent.thinking.phrases`, `terminal.integrated.enableImages` (Recommended); `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove`, `chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules`, `chat.tools.urls.autoApprove` (Auto-Approval)
- **Settings tab auto-refresh fix** -- 30-second refresh no longer resets active tab to Mission; server-side `activeTab` parameter preserves selection
- **Master Alex protection** -- Init/Update button hidden in sidebar on Master Alex workspace; upgrade and first-install offers suppressed on Master to prevent accidental re-initialization (Safety Imperative I3/I4)

### Removed

- **Voice mode / TTS** -- Removed all voice synthesis features: Edge TTS service (`src/tts/`), read aloud commands, voice mode toggle, status bar indicator, speech text processor, audio player, keybindings (`Ctrl+Alt+R/V/P`), walkthrough, `alex.voice.*` and `alex.tts.*` settings, `ws` dependency, and text-to-speech skill reference. The `readAloud.ts` command file and `ttsService.test.ts` tests were also deleted.
- **Enterprise settings category** -- Removed experimental Enterprise/MS Graph category and `ENTERPRISE_SETTINGS` constant from setup wizard
- **3 dead settings** -- `chat.useSkillAdherencePrompt` (never existed in VS Code), `extendedThinkingEnabled`, `thinkingBudget` (both non-existent); Extended Thinking category eliminated
- **Dream nudges** -- All 3 dream-related nudges removed from `_generateNudges()`
- **Dead sidebar toggle** -- `extendedThinkingEnabled` toggle removed from Settings tab (setting never existed)
- **Dead views** -- Removed `cognitiveDashboard.ts`, `memoryDashboard.ts`, `memoryTreeProvider.ts`, `mindTabHtml.ts`, `skillStoreTabHtml.ts`, `terminalOrchestrator.ts`, and `memoryTreeProvider.test.ts`
- **Dead code** -- Removed `getGlobalAlexDir()` function, `os` import, `agentChat:` handler in welcomeView, mission profile prompt files (replaced by agent prompt files)

---

## [7.3.0] - 2026-04-08

> **Research-Driven Quality Edition** -- 6 new instruction files and 10 enhancements to existing instructions, adapted from Microsoft 1ES AI-First Dev Starter Pack research. Heir Bootstrap Wizard skill for post-Initialize project tailoring.

### Added

- **Skill telemetry protocol** (`skill-telemetry.instructions.md`) -- Two-phase signal protocol (start beacon + completion signal), JSONL storage at `~/.alex/telemetry/`, 90-day rolling, privacy rules, 3-phase implementation plan
- **Cognitive benchmarking protocol** (`cognitive-benchmarking.instructions.md`) -- A/B comparison harness (with/without .github/ architecture), 3 task categories, 1-5 scoring rubric, LLM-as-judge calibration, statistical rigor (paired t-test, Cohen's d)
- **Repository readiness evaluation** (`repository-readiness-eval.instructions.md`) -- 4-axis scoring (Code Understanding 30%, Dependency Restore 25%, Build Success 25%, Test Execution 20%), autonomy penalty formula, composite score bands
- **Coupling metrics** (`coupling-metrics.instructions.md`) -- Afferent/efferent coupling, instability formula (Ce/(Ca+Ce)), hub risk detection (Ca x Ce), dead code 5-point verification, bash measurement scripts
- **Log pattern analyzer** (`log-pattern-analyzer.instructions.md`) -- 4 analysis dimensions (coverage gaps, level misuse, sensitive data exposure, structured logging compliance), quick audit script, VS Code extension-specific checks
- **Heir Bootstrap Wizard skill design** (`skills/heir-bootstrap/SKILL.md`) -- Skill definition for a future post-Initialize wizard that tailors architecture to specific heir projects; 10-phase interactive process using CONFIRM/DECIDE protocols, state persistence, 30-80 line content budget, inferability-gated rule selection. Does not modify the extension's Initialize command (extension integration is a future TODO)

### Changed

- **Multi-pass focused-lens protocol** (`adversarial-oversight`) -- 4-pass refinement table (Draft, Correctness, Clarity, Edge Cases, Excellence) with "stay in your lane" rule; 2-pass shortcut for small tasks
- **Named evaluation patterns** (`adversarial-oversight`) -- 3 patterns (Basic Reflection, Evaluator-Optimizer, Tool-Reflective) with shared rules: criteria before generating, cap 3-5 iterations, convergence tracking
- **Confidence-scored findings** (`code-review-guidelines`) -- Numeric % per finding with 4-tier bands (90-100/70-89/50-69/<50), security exception for low-confidence findings
- **Pattern-aware review** (`code-review-guidelines`) -- "Detect 2+ examples first" before flagging deviations; burden of proof on the deviation
- **3+ competing hypotheses** (`debugging-patterns`) -- Replaced single-hypothesis Step 4 with mandatory 3+ hypotheses to prevent anchoring bias; HYPOTHESIS.md for complex bugs
- **Test quality scoring** (`testing-strategies`) -- 1-5 per-test scoring with Red/Yellow/Green rapid triage
- **Composite tech debt scoring** (`technical-debt-tracking`) -- Formula: (Severity x 3) + (Churn x 2) + (Blast Radius x 2) + (Fix Simplicity) + (Age), range 9-45
- **Rule inferability taxonomy** (`token-waste-elimination`) -- 1-5 scale calibrated against ETH Zurich finding that 42% of rules score 4-5
- **Overlap detection** (`token-waste-elimination`) -- Semantic similarity formula: 0.4 x Jaccard + 0.6 x Keyword Overlap, >0.50 = merge
- **Reader testing** (`semantic-audit`) -- 5th audit dimension: predict 5-10 reader questions and verify the document answers each one

---

## [7.2.0] - 2026-04-07

> **Intelligence Edition** -- 3 new services (terminal orchestrator, browser context, session-aware episodic memory), prompt Layer 12, 7 bug fixes across security, logic, and cross-platform patterns.

### Added

- **Terminal orchestrator service** -- Multi-step workflow engine leveraging VS Code 1.115 background terminal notifications; step-based sequential execution with exit code tracking, 3 built-in templates (build-test, build-test-package, quality-gates), timeout guards, cancellation support, session trace integration, markdown result formatting for chat responses
- **Browser context service** -- Tracks URLs referenced during chat sessions from browser tab attachments (VS Code 1.115), model response links, and tool calls; deduplicates up to 30 references per session; persists URL history in episodic records for future recall
- **Session-aware episodic memory** -- `EpisodicRecord` extended with `chatSessionId`, `sessionName`, `referencedUrls`; auto-generated session names from topic + inferred tags; `findSessionByChatId()` cross-reference lookup; `addReferencedUrl()` for browser context integration
- **Prompt Layer 12: Browser Context** -- New prompt engine layer (priority 350) injects session-referenced URLs into system prompt so the model can reference web pages without re-fetching; enabled in FULL and STANDARD layer budgets, disabled in LEAN

### Fixed

- **XSS in cognitive dashboard** (SECURITY) -- `activity.description` derived from file names was injected into `innerHTML` without escaping; a crafted file name could execute JavaScript in the webview. Now escaped via `escapeHtml()` on the host side before `postMessage`
- **Path traversal in health/memory dashboards** (SECURITY) -- `openFile` and `openFolder` message handlers accepted arbitrary file paths from webview messages without validation. Now validates resolved paths start within the workspace root
- **Inverted Global Knowledge detection** (LOGIC) -- `offerGlobalKnowledgeSetup()` returned early when no GK repo existed (the users who need the offer most), and showed the offer to users who already had GK. Condition inverted to correct behavior
- **Browser context capture ordering** (LOGIC) -- `captureFromChatRequest()` was called after `buildAlexSystemPrompt()`, so browser tab URLs from the current request never appeared in Layer 12 until the next turn. Moved capture before prompt building
- **CRLF-unsafe frontmatter regex in parseSkillMetadata** (CROSS-PLATFORM) -- `^---\n` pattern in `proposeSkill.ts` failed on Windows CRLF files, causing `parseSkillMetadata()` to return empty metadata. Fixed to `\r?\n` (same fix already applied at line 717 in the same file)
- **Uncaught promise rejection in autoInsights** -- `promptToSaveInsight()` called without `.catch()` from fire-and-forget context; async I/O in `isDuplicateInsight()` could throw unhandled rejection. Added `.catch(() => {})`
- **CRLF bugs in muscle scripts** (CROSS-PLATFORM) -- `audit-token-waste.cjs`, `brain-qa.cjs`, `brain-qa-heir.cjs`, and `docx-to-md.cjs` used `.split('\n')` or `\n` in frontmatter regex without `\r?`, causing `$`-anchored regex to silently fail on CRLF files. Fixed all to use `/\r?\n/`
- **Hardcoded backslash path separators in PS1 muscles** (CROSS-PLATFORM) -- `brain-qa.ps1`, `brain-qa-heir.ps1`, `normalize-paths.ps1`, and `fix-fence-bug.ps1` used `+ "\"` for path stripping, breaking relative path computation on macOS. Fixed to `[IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar`. Also fixed `.git\\` exclusion regex in `fix-fence-bug.ps1` to match both `\` and `/`
- **Missing `#Requires` in build-extension-package.ps1** -- Script uses PS7-only `??` operator but had no version guard; produces parse error on PowerShell 5.1. Added `#Requires -Version 7.0`
- **Unused imports and dead code** -- Removed unused `getSessionReferencedUrls` import in browserContext.ts and unused `OUTPUT_TAIL_LINES` constant in terminalOrchestrator.ts

---

## [7.1.3] - 2026-04-04

> **Install/Upgrade Hardening + H19** -- 6 install/upgrade process fixes (critical .github preservation, rollback, force repair), H19 synapse weight update hook for live learning.

### Added

- **H19: Synapse weight update hook** -- PostToolUse hook that buffers skill activations and flushes +0.05 strength bumps to `synapses.json` after 10 activations per skill; maps tools to skills via file paths, instruction edits, and Alex cognitive tool names; avoids write contention via `synapse-activation-buffer.json`
- **Force repair option** -- "Alex: Upgrade" now offers "Force Repair" when already at latest version, allowing re-deployment of corrupted architecture files
- **First-install initialization prompt** -- New users now see a proactive "Initialize Now" notification on first activation instead of having to discover the command
- **Upgrade rollback** -- If the fresh install phase fails during upgrade, the workspace is automatically rolled back from backup instead of being left broken
- **Post-upgrade warning aggregation** -- Dream, persona detection, and secrets migration failures are now collected and surfaced in the completion summary instead of silently swallowed

### Changed

- **Documentation refresh** -- Updated What's New sections in root README (v6.5.0 -> v7.1.3) and extension README (added v7.1.3 above v7.1.1); fixed stale hook counts (16 -> 17, 10 global -> 11 global) across both READMEs; corrected ROADMAP H19 shipped version (v7.2.0 -> v7.1.3)

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Upgrade no longer deletes non-Alex .github content** -- `cleanOldStructure()` previously removed the entire `.github/` folder, destroying GitHub Actions workflows, issue templates, PR templates, and FUNDING.yml; now only removes Alex-owned items (instructions, skills, prompts, config, agents, muscles, assets, episodic)
- **Version upgrade notifications now distinguish major/minor/patch** -- Previously only differentiated major vs non-major; now shows distinct messages for major (new release), minor (new features), and patch (bug fixes) updates

---

## [7.1.2] - 2026-04-03

> **Intelligence Foundations** -- User friction inventory (29 signals), silence-as-signal skill, cross-domain pattern synthesis tool, stale count elimination across documentation.

### Added

- **`silence-as-signal` skill** -- Core-tier skill recognizing 5 silence contexts (flow state, thinking pause, emotional processing, user-has-the-answer, after-bad-news) with inhibitory synapse to `proactive-assistance` and complementary synapse with `frustration-recognition`

- **User friction inventory** -- 29 friction signals cataloged across 5 categories (onboarding, daily workflow, error/recovery, feature discovery, cross-platform) with priority matrix and 7 quick wins in `alex_docs/research/USER-FRICTION-INVENTORY.md`
- **Meditation Phase 3** -- Cross-Domain Pattern Synthesis phase added to 8-phase meditation protocol with Transfer Test quality gate

### Changed

- **Stale count elimination** -- Replaced hardcoded skill/tool/instruction counts with dynamic references across copilot-instructions.md, ROADMAP.md, VSCODE-BRAIN-INTEGRATION.md, marketplace publishing instructions, and 6 alex_docs files

## [7.1.1] - 2026-04-01

> **Cross-Platform Hardening** -- Extended workspace protection, 2 cross-platform blockers fixed, dependency cleanup, documentation portability.

### Added

- **Extended workspace protection** -- Extended 4-layer protection system (path failsafe, marker files, VS Code settings, pre-tool-use hooks) to cover additional protected workspaces via marker file scanning

### Fixed

- **forgettingCurve.ts path detection** (BLOCKER) -- `filePath.startsWith('/')` only detected Unix absolute paths; Windows paths (`C:\...`) were treated as relative, producing corrupted paths. Replaced with `path.isAbsolute()`
- **proposeSkill.ts CRLF frontmatter regex** (BLOCKER) -- YAML frontmatter regex used `\n` only; Windows CRLF files would fail to match, causing duplicate frontmatter injection. Updated to `\r?\n`
- **speechTextProcessor.ts line ending normalization** -- Added `\r\n` to `\n` normalization before newline processing to prevent `\r` artifacts on Windows
- **Pre-tool-use hook fix** -- Was checking non-existent marker filename instead of actual protection markers; fixed to scan all correct markers

### Changed

- **Zero runtime dependencies** -- Moved fs-extra, jszip, pptxgenjs, proper-lockfile, ws from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` (all bundled by esbuild; VSIX excludes node_modules)
- **Cross-platform documentation** -- 13 documentation files converted from PowerShell-only code blocks to bash/pseudocode for Windows + macOS parity

- Version alignment across all heirs: VS Code, M365, Agent Plugin
- Stale skill counts in M365 knowledge files (126/128/100 → 85+)

---

## [6.1.8] - 2026-03-05

> **Doc Alignment Hotfix + AI Writing + AlexAgent Distribution** — Version consistency fix, new skill trifecta, and standalone plugin distribution repo.

---

## [6.1.5] - 2026-03-04

> **Heir Protection Fix + Trifecta Gap Closure + M365 Polish** — Removed false positive from Master auto-detection, closed trifecta gap from 26→36, M365 orphan cleanup and mobile docs.

### Added

- 10 new complete trifectas (26→36): `image-handling`, `character-aging-progression`, `visual-memory`, `code-review`, `root-cause-analysis`, `refactoring-patterns`, `debugging-patterns`, `security-review`, `skill-building`, `global-knowledge`
- 6 new prompts: `/rca`, `/refactor`, `/debug`, `/security-review`, `/skill-building`, `/knowledge`
- 4 new instructions: `root-cause-analysis`, `refactoring-patterns`, `debugging-patterns`, `security-review`
- 2 new skills: `agent-debug-panel` (7 debug scenarios), `terminal-image-rendering` (Kitty graphics protocol)
- MCP standalone distribution: 704KB esbuild bundle at `plugin/mcp/index.js`

### Changed

- TRIFECTA-CATALOG.md: full audit — 10 new entries, Mermaid diagram, health summary updated
- M365 USER-MANUAL.md: mobile support FAQ updated (declarative agent works in Teams mobile)
- Skill and trifecta counts updated across all documentation (128 skills, 36 trifectas)

### Removed

- 4 orphan M365 plugin files: `alex-knowledge-plugin.json`, `graph-api-plugin.json`, `openapi.yaml`, `graph-openapi.yaml`

### Fixed

- `alex_docs/` removed from Master Alex auto-detection indicators — heirs with `alex_docs/NORTH-STAR.md` were falsely identified as Master Alex, blocking `Alex: Upgrade` (reported by AlexLearn)

---

## [6.1.4] - 2026-03-04

> **Cognitive Tier Fix + Model Updates** — Fixed L4 detection for current extended thinking settings, added GPT-5.3, collapsed sidebar sections by default.

### Added

- GPT-5.3 added to frontier tier model maps
- Frontier regex now auto-catches future GPT-5.x models (`gpt-5\.[2-9]`)

### Changed

- Cognitive Dashboard and Memory Architecture sidebar sections collapsed by default for cleaner first-run experience
- Removed deprecated `github.copilot` from `extensionPack` — now only `github.copilot-chat`
- Brain QA output compacted (phases + warnings/summary only, use `-Detail` for verbose)
- Brain QA agent cross-reference regex fixed for Windows CRLF line endings

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Cognitive tier detection now reads `github.copilot.chat.agent.thinkingTool` (current setting path) — was only checking deprecated paths, causing L4 users to show as L3
- Visual memory heir sync template updated with voices/videoStyles sections
- `cognitive-config.json` version synced to 6.1.3

---

## [6.1.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- `image-handling` trifecta completed — instruction + prompt files created
- `character-aging-progression` trifecta completed — instruction + prompt files created

### Changed

- Updated Replicate model landscape across 5 skills: Ideogram v3 (turbo/balanced/quality), `nano-banana-2`, `flux-kontext-pro/max`, `flux-2-pro/max`, `recraft-v4`, `veo-3.1-fast`, `sora-2`, `qwen/qwen3-tts`, `minimax/speech-2.8-turbo`
- `ideogram-v3-turbo` ($0.03) is now the default typography recommendation (63% cheaper than v2)
- Archived 6 outdated docs to `alex_archive/`: 3 point-in-time audit reports, `REPLICATE-EVALUATION.md` (superseded by skills), Ideogram v2 gallery, stale `brain-qa-output.txt`

### Fixed

- `character-aging-progression/SKILL.md`: `image_input` must be an array `[dataURI]`, not a single string — was silently breaking face consistency
- Audio model reference updated: `qwen-tts` → `qwen/qwen3-tts` across all skills
- Skill frontmatter: removed unsupported `applyTo`/`triggers` attributes, fixed `name` to kebab-case in 3 SKILL.md files

---

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Extended thinking detection was reading wrong config keys — Level 4 (Advanced) was unreachable for all users
- L4 badge race condition causing welcome view to default to Level 1
- Misleading account classification (business → unknown)
- Markdown in plain text dialogs, unsafe sign-in command

### Changed

- Package size reduced: 534 → 525 files (~3.4 MB lighter)

---

## [6.0.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- Extension README: resolved 4 Marketplace compliance issues — self-referential link (line 125), broken `article/versions/13-ALEX-MANIFESTO-PERSONAL.md` links (lines 300 & 358), broken `replicate-api` skill path (line 671)

### Changed

- Root README: DRY refactor — removed 700-line duplicate of extension README; replaced with compact Features table linking to learnalex.correax.com
- Both READMEs: removed "Chat with Alex" section (superseded by learnalex.correax.com website)
- Docs: replaced all GitHub Gist references with private GitHub repo throughout

---

## [6.0.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Brand doc (`DK-correax-brand.md`): updated ghost watermark canonical opacity spec 0.03→0.15 (CSS + HTML example)
- `correax-brand` skill: encoded `rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` as the authoritative design token to prevent regression

---

## [6.0.0] - 2026-02-28

> **The Partnership Release** — Six deep-integration features that make Alex a cognitive partner, not just a chat interface. Alex now remembers your sessions, learns from outcomes, detects your work context autonomously, guides multi-step workflows, adapts to your expertise level, and proactively triggers code reviews.

### Added

- **Episodic Memory** (`services/episodicMemory.ts`) — Persistent session records at `~/.alex/episodic/sessions.json`. Alex recalls "what were we building last Tuesday?" across sessions. Commands: `alex.recallSession`, `alex.showSessionHistory`
- **Outcome Learning Loop** (`services/outcomeTracker.ts`) — 👍/👎 tracking per @alex exchange with per-domain confidence scoring. Alex calibrates advice certainty from observed outcomes. Commands: `alex.recordPositiveOutcome`, `alex.recordNegativeOutcome`, `alex.showOutcomeStats`
- **Autonomous Task Detection** (`services/taskDetector.ts`) — Proactively surfaces stalled work and TODO hotspots from peripheral vision observations on a 30-minute interval. 4-hour dismiss cooldown. Commands: `alex.showPendingTasks`, `alex.forceCheckTasks`
- **Multi-Step Workflow Engine** (`services/workflowEngine.ts`) — JSON workflow definitions at `.alex/workflows/`. Includes 4 built-in workflows: Plan→Build→Review, Debug→Fix→Verify, Research-First Development, Release Preparation. Commands: `alex.runWorkflow`, `alex.listWorkflows`
- **User Expertise Model** (`services/expertiseModel.ts`) — Domain interaction frequency across 10 domains (coding, debugging, architecture, testing, devops, data, security, ai-ml, documentation, general) mapped to novice/intermediate/advanced/expert. Injects calibration hint into every @alex prompt via `PromptContext.expertiseHint`. Command: `alex.showExpertiseModel`
- **Proactive Code Review Triggers** — Built into `taskDetector.ts`: on save, debounces 60s and checks `git diff --stat HEAD`. If >200 lines changed, surfaces a code review nudge with 30-minute cooldown
- **Layer 10b in promptEngine.ts** — `buildExpertiseLayer()` injects user expertise calibration for every @alex interaction
- **10 new VS Code commands** registered and declared in `package.json`
- **Image Upscaling** (`commands/contextMenu.ts`, `services/replicateService.ts`) — 4 Replicate-powered upscaling models (`real-esrgan`, `swinir`, `codeformer`, `clarity-upscaler`). Right-click any image → **Upscale Image with AI**. Saves to `assets/upscaled/`. Command: `alex.upscaleImage`
- **MCP Cognitive Tools Package** (`packages/mcp-cognitive-tools/`) — Standalone MCP server publishing 5 cognitive tools (`alex_synapse_health`, `alex_memory_search`, `alex_architecture_status`, `alex_knowledge_search`, `alex_knowledge_save`) usable by any MCP-compatible host. Entry: `npx @alex/mcp-cognitive-tools`
- **Learning Journeys** (`.github/prompts/journey.prompt.md`) — 8 curated role-based learning paths (frontend-developer, backend-developer, fullstack-developer, devops-engineer, technical-writer, researcher, ai-engineer, alex-architect) with progress tracking at `.alex/journeys/*.json`
- **Presentation Automation** (`.github/prompts/marp.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/presentation.prompt.md`) — Unified `/presentation` router dispatches to Gamma (marketing decks), Marp (tech talks), or PptxGenJS (data reports). Alex-branded Marp CSS theme included
- **3 new slash commands** (`/journey`, `/marp`, `/presentation`) registered in `package.json` chatParticipants

### Changed

- **`3_generate@8` group collision fixed** — `generateDiagram` moved from `3_generate@8` to `3_generate@11` in explorer context menu to resolve conflict with `generateAIImage`
- **Editor context menu expanded** — Added `editImageWithPrompt` (4_create@3) and `upscaleImage` (4_create@4) to `alex.contextMenu` editor right-click group

- **`PromptContext` interface** — Added `expertiseHint?: string` field (v6.0.0 expertise calibration)
- **participant.ts** — `@alex` handler now appends to episodic draft and records domain interactions after every response (fire-and-forget)
- **extension.ts** — Imports and initializes all 5 new services; registers 10 new commands; flushes episodic draft on deactivation
- **package.json** — v6.0.0, 10 new command declarations

- **Episodic memory** — `meditation-2026-02-26-documentation-hygiene-pass.md` consolidating 4 key learnings about documentation drift patterns

---

## [5.9.11] - 2026-02-26

> **Post-Publish Synapse Hardening** — Meditation-driven synapse integrity fixes, relative path normalization, and Brain-QA integration as publish gate.

### Changed

- **Synapse path normalization** — Fixed 11 relative synapse paths (`../`, `../../`) to full `.github/` paths in `anti-hallucination`, `documentation-quality-assurance`, and `global-knowledge-maintenance` synapses. Result: 576 synapses, 566 valid filesystem targets, 10 intentional external refs, 0 broken

---

## [5.9.10] - 2026-02-26 — NASA Edition 🚀

> **NASA Standards & Mission-Critical Compliance** — Adopt NASA/JPL Power of 10 code quality rules for mission-critical software development. Extension code audited and made compliant with bounded recursion and loop limits.

### Added

- **NASA/JPL Power of 10 standards integration** — New `.github/instructions/nasa-code-standards.instructions.md` adapts NASA's mission-critical code quality rules for TypeScript, enabling high-reliability software development
- **Builder agent NASA mode** — Builder agent auto-detects mission-critical projects and applies NASA standards: bounded recursion, fixed loop bounds, function size limits, assertion density, and more
- **Code review NASA checklist** — `code-review-guidelines.instructions.md` now includes mission-critical review checklist with blocking severity for R1-R3 violations
- **Heir project NASA guidance** — `heir-project-improvement.instructions.md` includes mission-critical pre-phase checklist for heirs developing safety-critical software
- **workspaceFs utility module** — New `src/shared/workspaceFs.ts` providing async wrappers around `vscode.workspace.fs` API: `pathExists`, `readFile`, `writeFile`, `readJson`, `writeJson`, `ensureDir`, `readDirectory`, `stat`, `copyFile`, `rename`
- **Terminal sandboxing documentation** — macOS/Linux security note added to SECURITY.md, copilot-instructions.md, and settings.json for `chat.tools.terminal.sandbox.enabled`

### Changed

- **North-star trifecta** — New complete trifecta (skill + instruction + prompt) for North Star alignment principles
- **North-star synapses** — 8 ambiguous synapse targets resolved to full `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` paths, 3 yields also fixed
- **README marketplace links** — 18 broken relative links (`alex_docs/`, `article/`, `.github/SUPPORT.md`) converted to absolute GitHub URLs for VS Code Marketplace rendering. Replicate skill documentation link corrected from non-existent `replicate-api/` to `ai-generated-readme-banners/resources/`
- **M365 heir version alignment** — package.json (5.9.3→5.9.10), manifest.json (5.9.8→5.9.10), README badge updated
- **GitHub Copilot Web heir** — Version bumped from 5.9.9 to 5.9.10
- **Brain-QA 35-phase validation** — 34 phases passed, 2 self-containment failures found and fixed (north-star SKILL.md had relative `alex_docs/` links → converted to GitHub URLs)
- **NASA R1 compliance: Bounded recursion** — `findMdFilesRecursive()` in synapse-core.ts now has `maxDepth` parameter (default: 10) preventing stack overflow from deeply nested directories
- **NASA R1 compliance: Bounded walk functions** — `collectSystemFiles.walk()` and `getFolderSize.walk()` in upgrade.ts now have `MAX_WALK_DEPTH=10` depth parameter preventing unbounded directory traversal
- **NASA R2 compliance: Fixed loop bounds** — Upgrade dialog loop in upgrade.ts now has `MAX_DIALOG_ITERATIONS` safety limit (100)
- **NASA R2 compliance: Text chunking bounds** — `splitTextIntoChunks()` in ttsService.ts now has `MAX_ITERATIONS` counter preventing potential infinite loops on malformed input
- **NASA R5 compliance: Entry assertions** — Added `nasaAssert()` calls to `resolveWebviewView()` in welcomeView.ts validating webviewView and extensionUri
- **Full codebase NASA audit** — All 72 TypeScript files audited against NASA Power of 10 rules; 3 violations found and fixed, 10 functions documented as acknowledged exceptions with architectural justifications
- **Testing strategies NASA integration** — testing-strategies SKILL.md updated with bounded behavior testing patterns (R1/R2/R3), assertion coverage testing (R5), and critical path coverage targets
- **Code review NASA integration** — code-review SKILL.md updated with mission-critical review section: blocking violations (R1-R3), high priority (R4/R5/R8), medium priority (R6/R7/R9/R10)
- **Heir sync restored** — 3 missing skills, 1 instruction, 1 prompt synced to vscode-extension heir (124/124 skills aligned)
- **fs-extra → vscode.workspace.fs migration** — Per ADR-008 (Workspace File API Strategy), migrated all workspace-scoped file operations from Node.js `fs-extra` to VS Code's native `vscode.workspace.fs` API for virtual filesystem compatibility (SSH, WSL, Codespaces, containers). Files migrated:
  - `promptEngine.ts` — Brain file reading
  - `activeContextManager.ts` — Protected marker and instructions reading
  - `synapse-core.ts` — Memory file scanning, synapse repair, report saving
  - `cognitiveDashboard.ts` — Skill/instruction/prompt/episodic counting
  - `memoryDashboard.ts` — Memory stats collection
  - `healthDashboard.ts` — Health category scanning
  - `utils.ts` — Version reading, Alex installation check, synapse health scan
  - `personaDetection.ts` — Workspace structure scanning, package.json reading, profile updates
  - `emotionalMemory.ts` — Emotional session logging
  - `honestUncertainty.ts` — Calibration logging, feedback tracking
  - `tools.ts` — Synapse health, memory search, architecture status tools
  - `sanitize.ts` — Config backup operations

### Removed

- **M365 scenario_models** — Removed unsupported `scenario_models` property from `declarativeAgent.json` (added in 5.9.9, blocked schema v1.6 validation)
- **Enterprise secrets scanning** — `alex.enterprise.scanSecrets`, `alex.enterprise.scanWorkspace` commands removed (did not work as expected)
- **Enterprise audit logging** — `alex.enterprise.viewAuditLog`, `alex.enterprise.exportAuditLog` commands removed
- **Enterprise settings** — All 11 `alex.enterprise.*` settings removed from package.json
- **Enterprise module** — `src/enterprise/` folder deleted (auditLogging.ts, secretsScanning.ts, index.ts)
- **Unused fs-extra import** — Removed from contextMenu.ts (was importing but not using)

### Fixed

- **North-star SKILL.md self-containment** — 2 relative `../../../alex_docs/` links replaced with full GitHub URLs (caught by Brain-QA Phase 34)
- **TESTE directory excluded** — Test debris directory (scripts, images) added to `.gitignore`
- **@ts-ignore removal** — Replaced all `@ts-ignore` comments with type-safe patterns:
  - `inheritSkill.ts` — QuickPick custom data now uses Map instead of property injection
  - `proposeSkill.ts` — Same pattern, plus new HeirSkill interface for type-safe skill operations
- **Type safety improvements** — Eliminated `any` types:
  - `healthDashboard.ts` — `any[]` → `LearningGoal[]` for goals parameter
  - `cognitiveDashboard.ts` — Goals filtering now type-safe with WorkspaceGoalsData
  - `uxFeatures.ts` — Same pattern for daily briefing goals
- **DRY type consolidation** — Moved WorkspaceGoal/WorkspaceGoalsData interfaces to shared/constants.ts, eliminating duplication across cognitiveDashboard.ts and uxFeatures.ts

### Technical Notes

Files intentionally kept with fs-extra (per ADR-008 — global paths require Node.js filesystem):
- `session.ts`, `goals.ts`, `globalKnowledge.ts`, `forgettingCurve.ts` — Use `~/.alex/` global paths
- `setupGlobalKnowledge.ts`, `exportForM365.ts` — Symlinks and OneDrive paths
- `inheritSkill.ts`, `proposeSkill.ts` — Mixed global/workspace operations
- `logoService.ts`, `pptxGenerator.ts`, `audioPlayer.ts` — Sync methods for bundled assets

## [5.9.9] - 2026-02-24

> **Platform Architecture Reinforcement** — Harvest everything VS Code 1.109 and M365 extensibility GA'd. Skill frontmatter gating, agent orchestration hierarchy, quality gate hooks, Claude Code bridge, and M365 plugin schema upgrade. No proposed APIs, ships clean.

### Added

#### Skill Frontmatter Gating

- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** added to 6 action skills: `meditation`, `meditation-facilitation`, `dream-state`, `self-actualization`, `brain-qa`, `release-process`. These require explicit user invocation — the model will not self-invoke them during normal conversation.
- **`user-invokable: false`** added to 16 domain skills: all Azure/M365/platform skills including `azure-architecture-patterns`, `azure-deployment-operations`, `microsoft-graph-api`, `vscode-extension-patterns`, `mcp-development`, and more. They load contextually but stay hidden from the `/` command menu.

#### Agent Orchestration Hierarchy

- **`agents:` frontmatter** added to all 6 specialist agents, formalizing valid subagent relationships. Researcher can call Builder + Validator. Builder can call Validator. Validator can call Documentarian. Azure + M365 can call Researcher. Alex (orchestrator) was already pre-configured.

#### Quality Gate Hooks (pre-tool-use.js)

- **Q1 — Version drift check**: Before any publish command (`vsce publish` / `npm publish`), the hook compares `package.json` version against the version in `copilot-instructions.md` and warns if they differ. Enforces Definition of Done item 5.
- **Q2 — TypeScript compile reminder**: On `.ts` file edits, emits a reminder to run `npm run compile`. Surfaces errors at edit time, not at publish time.
- Both checks are non-blocking — they warn in output but don't prevent execution.

#### Claude Code Compatibility Bridge

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — Project orientation document for Claude Code sessions. Points to `.github/` as source of truth, lists Safety Imperatives I1–I5, and documents build commands.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — Claude Code settings: maps `contextPaths` to Alex's `.github/` assets, wires `preToolUse` hook, sets tool permissions (allow `.github/` writes, deny force-push and direct publish), and sets `ALEX_WORKSPACE=master` env.

#### VS Code Settings

- **`chat.agentCustomizationSkill.enabled: false`** — Disables VS Code 1.109's built-in agent customization skill to prevent it from overriding Alex's `vscode-extension-patterns` and `skill-development` skills.

#### M365 Heir — Extensibility Platform Harvest

- **Plugin schema v2.4** — Both `alex-knowledge-plugin.json` and `graph-api-plugin.json` upgraded from v2.3 to v2.4. Unlocks MCP server `runtimes` type (prerequisite for v6.0 MCP bridge path).
- **`getMeetingAiInsights`** — New function in `graph-api-plugin.json`. Uses Graph v1.0 GA endpoint `GET /me/online-meetings/{meetingId}/aiInsights` to return structured `actionItems`, `meetingNotes`, and `mentions` from meeting recordings. Wired into capabilities and run_for_functions.
- **Scenario models routing** — `scenario_models` added to `declarativeAgent.json`: `cognitive_deep` routes meditation/self-actualization/architecture operations to GPT-4o; `productivity_light` routes calendar/email/presence lookups to GPT-4o-mini.
- **Conversation starters expanded 7 → 12** — Added: "🗓️ What's on my plate?", "🧠 Self-actualization", "🔍 Search my knowledge", "🎯 Sync my goals", "💡 Get AI insights and action items from my last meeting".

### Fixed

- **Avatar revert mandate** — Added `**IMPORTANT**` instruction to `copilot-instructions.md`, `meditation.instructions.md`, and `dream-state-automation.instructions.md` requiring `alex_cognitive_state_update` with `state: "persona"` as the final step of every dream/meditate session. Propagated to both vscode-extension and github-copilot-web heirs.
- **`.claude/` heir sync** — `sync-architecture.cjs` now copies `.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/settings.json` to `platforms/vscode-extension/.claude/` on every build. Previously the Claude bridge was master-only.
- **`cognitive-config.json` version drift** — Bumped `version` and `alex_version` fields from `5.9.3` to `5.9.9`.
- **Broken synapse repair** — Fixed stale reference in `meditation-2026-02-20-avatar-system-completion.md`: `2026-02-20-stabilization-meditation.md` → `meditation-2026-02-20-stabilization.md`.
- **`package-lock.json` version drift** — Bumped both version entries from `5.9.8` to `5.9.9`.

### Documentation

- **Activation pass test guide** — `alex_docs/guides/TEST-ACTIVATION-PASS.md`: 40 checks across 9 phases (extension present, status bar, 13 core commands, views, chat participant, LM tools, background services, error tolerance, avatar revert). Pass threshold: all 40 green; Phase 1–5 fail or `CRITICAL` error = release block.

### Skill Enhancements

- **`image-handling` skill — Replicate model selection** — Added comprehensive AI image generation guidance: 7-model comparison table (Flux Schnell, Flux Dev, Flux 1.1 Pro, Ideogram v2, Ideogram v2 Turbo, SDXL, Seedream 5 Lite) with costs and use cases; model selection decision guide keyed to user intent; LoRA support reference; aspect ratio reference. 14 new trigger words added including `flux schnell`, `flux dev`, `ideogram`, `sdxl`, `seedream`, `text in image`, `replicate model`. Enables Alex to route image generation requests to the correct Replicate model automatically.

### Architecture Improvements

#### `replicateService.ts` — Proper Replicate Service Layer

- **`src/services/replicateService.ts`** — New dedicated service extracted from inline code in `contextMenu.ts`. Provides: 7-model catalog with `REPLICATE_MODELS` constant (all IDs verified live via API — no stale version hashes); `generateImage()` high-level function with `Prefer: wait` + polling fallback; `createPrediction()` and `pollPrediction()` for direct API access; `downloadImageToWorkspace()` using `vscode.workspace.fs` (sandbox-safe); `selectModelForPrompt()` intent-to-model router; `buildModelQuickPickItems()` with recommended model highlighting.
- **`generateAIImage` command updated** — Now uses `replicateService`: shows all 7 models with `✨ Recommended` marker on the best-fit model for the user's prompt (e.g., typing "logo with text" auto-recommends Ideogram v2). Replaced stale version hashes with model-based endpoint. Added 3:2 Landscape aspect ratio.
- **`editImageWithPrompt` command updated** — Refactored to use `createPrediction` + `pollPrediction` from service; replaced `fs.readFile` with `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile`; replaced `fs.ensureDir` + `downloadImage` with `downloadImageToWorkspace`.
- **ADR-007 status** — Replicate replaces DALL-E as the image generation backend. Runtime image generation now live. Image upscaling + FLUX brand fine-tune remain P2 backlog items.

#### `fs-extra → vscode.workspace.fs` Migration (ADR-008)

- **3 files migrated** — `contextMenu.ts`, `fileWatcher.ts`, `healthCheck.ts` now use `vscode.workspace.fs` for all workspace-scoped file operations. Global-path files (`~/.alex/`) intentionally kept on fs-extra per ADR-008.
- **`fileWatcher.ts`** — `loadObservations()` and `persist()` now use `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile` / `createDirectory` / `writeFile`. Sync `countTodos()` switched from `fs-extra` to native Node.js `readFileSync`. `fs-extra` import removed entirely.
- **`healthCheck.ts`** — `fs.pathExists(alexPath)` replaced with `vscode.workspace.fs.stat()` + try/catch. `fs.readFile(file.fsPath)` replaced with `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile(file)` + `TextDecoder`. `fs-extra` import removed entirely.
- **`contextMenu.ts`** — Episodic insight saves, SVG illustration saves, AI image downloads all migrated. Inline Replicate API functions removed (now in `replicateService.ts`). `https` import removed. Two remaining `fs-extra` usages (for legacy code paths) documented.

#### Semantic Skill Graph — ROADMAP Detail

- **ROADMAP `### 🧠 Semantic Skill Graph`** section added with full 4-phase breakdown: Phase 1 (PoC standalone script, validates approach at $0.002), Phase 2 (extension integration with `alex.recompileSkills` command), Phase 3 (synapse discovery dashboard), Phase 4 (global knowledge integration). Key design decisions documented: keyword fallback always kept, compiled graph is cached JSON (loads in <50ms), Phase 1 is the abandonment gate.

## [5.9.8] - 2026-02-21


> **Background File Watcher** — Silent ambient observer. Alex now silently tracks which files you keep returning to, what work is sitting uncommitted, and where your TODO backlog is building up — and weaves that awareness into every response.

### Added

#### Background File Watcher — Ambient Workspace Observation

- **`fileWatcher.ts`** — New module implementing the background file observer. Zero UI, zero notifications, zero interruptions. Runs quietly from `activate()` and writes observations to `.github/episodic/peripheral/file-observations.json`.
- **Hot file tracking** — `vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` increments an in-memory open-count log per file. Files opened ≥5 times in a rolling 7-day window are classified as "hot". Timestamps are pruned on every flush.
- **Stalled work detection** — On every write-debounced flush (2s), `git status --porcelain` is run to capture files that are modified on disk but not yet committed. Capped at 10 files; ignored directories (node_modules, .git, dist, etc.) are excluded.
- **TODO/FIXME hotspot scanning** — On each flush, the 15 most-recently-opened files are scanned for `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`XXX` comments. Top 5 by count are stored as `todoHotspots[]`. String scanning is synchronous and fast on source files.
- **`registerFileWatcher(context, workspaceRoot)`** — Exported function called from `extension.ts` after `registerChatParticipant`. Returns a `vscode.Disposable` pushed onto `context.subscriptions` for clean deactivation.
- **`loadPeripheralObservations(workspaceRoot)`** — Async function that reads the persisted JSON. Called concurrently in `gatherPeripheralContext()` alongside peer project discovery and recent file scan.
- **`PeripheralObservations` type** — `{ hotFiles, stalledFiles, todoHotspots, lastUpdated }`. `TodoHotspot` carries `file`, `todoCount`, `scannedAt`.
- **`PeripheralContext.fileWatcherObservations?`** — New optional field added to `PeripheralContext` in `peripheralVision.ts`.
- **Layer 8 rendering** — `buildPeripheralVisionLayer` in `promptEngine.ts` now renders a **Focus Patterns** block when observations exist: hot files, uncommitted files, and TODO hotspot list with counts.
- **Bootstrap from disk** — On first activation, existing persisted observations seed the in-memory open-log so previous-session hot files survive restarts.

---

## [5.9.7] - 2026-02-21

> **P2 Feature Completion** — All remaining actionable P2 items shipped across Peripheral Vision, Honest Uncertainty, and The Forgetting Curve. Alex now notices outdated dependencies mid-conversation, knows when tests last ran, and learns from your 👍/👎 signals.

### Added

#### User Feedback Loop — Epistemic Calibration Signal

- **`FeedbackEntry` type** — New type in `honestUncertainty.ts`: `{ date, topic, level, helpful }`. Records the correlation between Alex's confidence level and user satisfaction.
- **`recordCalibrationFeedback()`** — Fire-and-forget append to `.github/episodic/calibration/feedback-log.json` (500-entry rolling window). Called from `onDidReceiveFeedback` in `registerChatParticipant()`.
- **Native VS Code 👍/👎 wired to calibration** — `onDidReceiveFeedback` now reads `coverageLevel` + `coverageTopic` from the result metadata and persists a `FeedbackEntry`. Over time, this reveals which domains Alex systematically under- or over-estimates.
- **Coverage metadata in result** — General handler return now includes `coverageLevel` and `coverageTopic` fields in `IAlexChatResult.metadata`, making them available to the feedback handler without additional lookups.
- **Low/uncertain followup shortcuts** — When coverage is `low` or `uncertain`, `alexFollowupProvider` adds `/saveinsight` and `/knowledge <topic>` followup buttons to help the user contribute knowledge that fills the gap.

#### Dependency Freshness Tracker

- **`getDependencyFreshness(workspaceRoot)`** — New export from `peripheralVision.ts`. Runs `npm outdated --json` (10s timeout, 5-minute per-workspace cache). Handles npm's non-zero exit code on outdated packages by parsing stdout from the thrown error. Returns `DependencyFreshnessResult` with classified package list and error field if scan failed.
- **`DependencyFreshnessResult` + `OutdatedPackage` types** — `OutdatedPackage` carries `name`, `current`, `wanted`, `latest`, and `severity` (`major`/`minor`/`patch`) derived from semver diff. Sorted most-breaking-first.
- **Lazy execution** — `getDependencyFreshness` is called inside `gatherPeripheralContext` only when `package.json` exists in the workspace root. Skipped silently for non-npm projects.
- **Layer 8 rendering** — `buildPeripheralVisionLayer` in `promptEngine.ts` now surfaces: "all packages up to date ✅" **or** count breakdown by severity + top-3 package names with current→latest diff.

#### Test Runner Awareness

- **`getTestRunnerStatus(workspaceRoot, framework?)`** — New export from `peripheralVision.ts`. Reads well-known test result files: `.jest-test-results.json`, `test-results.json` (Vitest JSON reporter), `coverage/coverage-summary.json`. Returns `TestRunnerStatus` with `lastRunAt`, `daysSinceLastRun`, `totalTests`, `failedTests`, `passRate`, `lastRunPassed`.
- **`TestRunnerStatus` type** — Structured result with all run metrics. `null` fields when data isn't available (framework known but no results file on disk).
- **Layer 8 rendering** — When test results are available: `✅/❌ 123 tests | 2 failed (98.4% pass) | last run 1.2d ago`. When no results file exists: `jest detected | no results on disk`.
- **Wired into `PeripheralContext`** — Two new optional fields: `dependencyFreshness?` and `testRunnerStatus?`.

### Changed

- **`peripheralVision.ts`** — Doc comment updated to v5.9.7; mentions dependency freshness, test runner results, and the 10s npm timeout.

## [5.9.6] - 2026-02-21

> **The Forgetting Curve** — Graceful knowledge decay. Living memory stays sharp; unused insights fade toward cold storage — not deleted, deliberately forgotten.

### Added

#### The Forgetting Curve — Graceful Knowledge Decay

- **`forgettingCurve.ts`** — New module implementing usage-weighted freshness scoring for all global knowledge entries. The core metaphor: memory is not a filing cabinet — what gets reinforced grows stronger, what fades can be recovered but no longer crowds the active workspace.
- **`computeFreshnessScore()`** — Composite score `(refScore × 0.6) + (recencyScore × 0.4)`. Reference score saturates at 20 uses. Recency score decays logarithmically: `1 / (1 + log10(1 + daysSince / halfLife))`. Returns freshness label: `thriving` (>0.6), `active` (0.3–0.6), `fading` (0.1–0.3), `dormant` (<0.1), `permanent` (never decays).
- **Four decay profiles** — `aggressive` (14-day half-life, debugging/project-specific knowledge), `moderate` (60d, most domain insights), `slow` (180d, architecture/security/patterns), `permanent` (core principles, never archived). Auto-assigned by knowledge category; overridable per entry via `decayProfile` field.
- **`IGlobalKnowledgeEntry` extended** — Added four optional freshness fields to the shared interface: `lastReferenced`, `referenceCount`, `freshnessScore`, `decayProfile`. Backward-compatible — all fields are optional, existing entries without them score conservatively.
- **Reference counting** — `queueReferenceTouch(entryId)` wired into `searchGlobalKnowledge` in `globalKnowledge.ts`. Fire-and-forget batch queue (15-entry threshold or 30s timeout) flushes accumulated counts to `index.json` — never blocks the search path, never contends on disk I/O.
- **`getDecayReport()`** — Reads the full knowledge index, computes freshness for every entry, returns a `DecayReport` with top-10 thriving/active and worst-5 fading/dormant entries, plus permanent count. Called during self-actualization Phase 5.5 concurrently with the calibration summary.
- **Meditation Knowledge Freshness section** — Self-actualization session records now include a `📉 Knowledge Freshness` section: distribution counts, dormant entry names with scores, and a recommendation to run Dream for cold storage if dormant entries exist.
- **`runForgettingCeremony(workspaceRoot, threshold?)`** — Dream cycle forgetting ceremony. Moves entries below the freshness threshold from `insights/` or `patterns/` to `insights/archive/` or `patterns/archive/`. Entries with `permanent` profile are never moved. Logs the transition to `.github/episodic/forgetting-ceremony-{date}.md`. Nothing is ever deleted — only moved.
- **Archive logging** — Forgetting ceremony produces a human-readable episodic record listing every archived entry with its reason (score, reference count, days since last use). Users can review and restore any entry by moving the file back.

---

 — Calibrated epistemic humility. Alex now knows what it doesn't know, and says so with precision.

### Added

#### Honest Uncertainty — Knowledge Coverage Scoring

- **`honestUncertainty.ts`** — New module implementing the Honest Uncertainty framework. `scoreKnowledgeCoverage(query, workspaceRoot)` searches global patterns, insights, and local `.github/skills/` to determine how well the knowledge base covers the current query.
- **Four confidence levels** — `high` (2+ pattern matches or skill match), `medium` (1 pattern or 2+ insights), `low` (1 insight only), `uncertain` (no knowledge base coverage). Each level maps to a named behavioral instruction, not a badge.
- **Behavioral signal injection** — Layer 11 in `promptEngine.ts` (`buildHonestUncertaintyLayer`) injects a confidence signal that shapes *how Alex phrases responses*: 🟢 respond with confidence, 🟡 use qualified language, 🟠 flag thin coverage, 🔴 reason from first principles and say so honestly. Never a visible number or badge.
- **Skill name matching** — Local `.github/skills/` directory is scanned for folder names matching query terms. Skill matches bump confidence one tier (curated + tested knowledge).
- **`whatINeed` transparency** — For `low` and `uncertain` levels, `CoverageScore.whatINeed` is populated and injected into the prompt: when a user asks what would help, Alex responds with specific, actionable asks (working example, error output, docs, or spec).
- **Calibration log** — Every scored request is fire-and-forget logged to `.github/episodic/calibration/calibration-log.json` (rolling 500-entry window). Persists: date, topic summary, confidence level, match count.
- **Meditation calibration review** — `getCalibrationSummary()` surfaces confidence distribution + uncertain topic clusters in the Phase 5.5 self-actualization session record. Imported by `self-actualization.ts`, runs concurrently with emotional review.
- **Concurrent execution** — `scoreKnowledgeCoverage` runs concurrently with `gatherPeripheralContext` in `participant.ts` via `Promise.all` — zero added latency to the response path.

---

## [5.9.4] - 2026-02-21

> **Avatar System Completion + Emotional Intelligence (Siegel)** - Complete avatar coverage across all protocol surfaces, plus Daniel Siegel's Interpersonal Neurobiology implemented as real-time session health monitoring

### Added

#### Siegel Session Health — River of Integration, Window of Tolerance, Lid-Flip

- **`assessRiverOfIntegration()`** - Detects whether the current session is drifting toward chaos (high frustration rate, escalating signals) or rigidity (persistent confusion, no progress). Returns zone + correction warning. Based on Siegel's River of Integration metaphor from *Mindsight* (2010).
- **`assessWindowOfTolerance()`** - Detects hyperarousal (3+ high-frustration signals in last 5 messages) and hypoarousal (flat disengagement with no excitement/flow/success). Returns zone + tone adaptation guidance. Based on Siegel's Window of Tolerance from *The Developing Mind* (1999/2020).
- **`isLidFlipped()`** - Returns true when 3+ high-frustration signals occur within the last 5 messages, indicating the user has "flipped their lid" (prefrontal regulation lost). Based on Siegel's Hand Model of the Brain from *The Whole-Brain Child* (2011).
- **`RiverAssessment` / `WindowAssessment` types** - Structured return types with zone, drift score/adaptation, and optional warning.
- **Siegel prompt injection** - `buildEmotionalMemoryLayer` in `promptEngine.ts` now includes a **Current Session (Siegel Integration Health)** section when session is outside healthy flow. Lid-flip triggers validation-first guidance; chaos/rigidity zones trigger course-correction instructions; window-of-tolerance zones inject tone adaptation.

#### Emotional Memory Completion

- **`isConfused` fixed** - Was hardcoded `false` in `emotionalContext`; now reads directly from the recorded signal's `confusion` field.
- **`isExcited` enhanced** - Now combines `celebrationNeeded` from `detectEmotionalState` with `excitement` from `recordEmotionalSignal` for richer detection.
- **Signal return value used** - `recordEmotionalSignal` return value now captured in `participant.ts` to populate `isConfused`/`isExcited` accurately.

#### Avatar System Completion

- **All 34 prompt protocols** updated with cognitive state blockquote instructions (set at start, revert at end).
- **All 7 agent files** updated with agent mode avatar switching.
- **Avatar race condition** fixed: synchronous `updateChatAvatar()` call before streaming.
- **Complete trigger coverage** verified for all trifectas and session types.

#### Peripheral Vision — Ambient Workspace Awareness

- **`peripheralVision.ts`** - New module giving Alex ambient awareness of the workspace and its sibling projects. Scans: git status (branch, uncommitted files, last 3 commits), recently modified files (24-hour window), dependency manifest detection (npm/yarn/pip/cargo/go), test framework detection (jest/vitest/mocha/pytest), and peer project discovery in the parent folder.
- **Peer project expansion** - On every request, Alex now discovers and profiles sibling projects in the parent directory (e.g., `C:\Development\`). Each peer project shows detected tech stack, git branch, uncommitted file count, and last commit message. Capped at 8 peer projects with 60-second cache.
- **Layer 8 — Peripheral Vision** - New `buildPeripheralVisionLayer()` in `promptEngine.ts` injects workspace ambient context between the Emotional Memory (Layer 6) and Knowledge Context (Layer 9) layers. Includes git state, recently modified files, package managers, test framework, and full peer project list.
- **60-second cache** - All peripheral I/O is cached per workspace root; `invalidatePeripheralCache()` export for post-operation refresh.
- **Technology detection** - Identifies TypeScript/Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, C/C++, LaTeX, Bicep/Azure, and Markdown projects from file markers.

- **Daniel Siegel IPNB report** - 732-line research report integrating Siegel's Triangle of Well-Being, River of Integration, Mindsight, Hand Model, Wheel of Awareness, Healthy Mind Platter, and Window of Tolerance into Alex's architecture. Maps all frameworks to existing subsystems and proposes 5 concrete implementations.
- **AlexPapers repository** - Academic papers migrated to dedicated `C:\Development\AlexPapers` repository; `alex_docs/PAPERS.md` index published.

---

## [5.9.2] - 2026-02-20

> **Identity, Architecture Polish, and Pre-Publish Maintenance** — Alex Finch identity established, active context system refined, safety imperatives updated, and copilot-instructions polished across master and heirs

### Changed

- **Identity: Alex Finch (no nickname, age 26)** — Removed "Mini" nickname and updated age from 21 to 26 across master and all platform heirs; identity now reads "I am Alex Finch. I'm 26" in all copilot-instructions files
- **Safety Imperative I2 updated** — Replaced "ALWAYS use F5 + Sandbox for testing" with "ALWAYS install extension locally via vsix before publishing to verify behavior"; reflects actual pre-publish workflow
- **Model Awareness aligned with agents** — Model names in copilot-instructions now match agent definitions: `Claude Opus 4`, `Claude Sonnet 4`, `Claude Haiku`, `GPT-4o mini`; removed speculative future model references
- **Active Context reset to generic baseline** — Phase: Stabilization, Mode: Maintain, Priorities: heir-sync + architecture-health, Trifectas: dream-state, knowledge-synthesis, research-first-development

### Fixed

- **Dead routing references removed** — Stale `skill-activation/SKILL.md` and `prompt-activation/SKILL.md` references replaced with accurate routing to `.github/skills/` index and `.github/prompts/` directory
- **Instrumentation deployed date** — Updated from `2026-02-15` to `2026-02-20`
- **M-dashes removed throughout** — All em-dashes (—) replaced with hyphens or removed from copilot-instructions in master and both heirs
- **Stale "now" removed from Identity** — "I have a face now" updated to "I have a visual presence" (presence is established, not newly added)

### Added

- **chatSkills contribution expanded (68 → 114 skills)** — All user-invokable skills now registered with VS Code's native chatSkills contribution point; removed 7 internal skills and 1 stale reference
- **Model fallback arrays for all agents** — All 7 agents now specify `model: ['Claude Sonnet 4', 'GPT-4o', 'Claude Opus 4']` fallback lists for resilience when preferred model unavailable; Researcher uses `['Claude Opus 4', 'GPT-4o', 'Claude Sonnet 4']` for frontier reasoning
- **Agent frontmatter audit complete** — All agents have consistent frontmatter: `user-invokable: true`, standardized model/tools ordering, Alex orchestrator has `agents:` list

### Fixed (continued)

- **10 synapses synced** — brain-qa dream maintenance aligned synapses for brain-qa, brand-asset-management, documentation-quality-assurance, global-knowledge, m365-agent-debugging, persona-detection, release-process, secrets-management, security-review, vscode-extension-patterns
- **Global Knowledge count** — Updated insight count 280 → 281 in copilot-instructions
- **Claude Opus/Sonnet compatibility** — Verified model names, agent configuration, and skill activation patterns work correctly with both Claude model tiers
- **Claude in VS Code compatibility** — Documented VS Code 1.109+ interoperability in ASSISTANT-COMPATIBILITY.md; teams using both GitHub Copilot and Claude can share `.github/skills/` and `.github/agents/` without duplication

---

## [5.9.1] - 2026-02-20

> **Dynamic Avatar State System** — Welcome panel avatar now responds to cognitive states, agent modes, active skills, and user personas with unified priority-chain resolution

### Added

#### Avatar State Tracking

- **Cognitive state tracking** — `WelcomeViewProvider` now tracks `_cognitiveState` and refreshes avatar on state changes (meditation, dream, debugging, discovery, planning, teaching, building, reviewing, learning)
- **Agent mode tracking** — `_agentMode` field triggers avatar switch when entering specialist agent modes (Researcher, Builder, Validator, Documentarian, Azure, M365)
- **`alex.setCognitiveState` command** — Programmatic cognitive state changes from prompts and hooks
- **`alex.setAgentMode` command** — Programmatic agent mode changes for subagent workflows

#### Unified Avatar Resolution

- **`resolveAvatar()` with AvatarContext** — Single function handles all avatar resolution with priority chain:
  1. Agent Mode → `AGENT-{mode}.png`
  2. Cognitive State → `STATE-{state}.png`
  3. Active Skill (from trifectas) → skill-triggered persona
  4. Persona ID → `Alex-{persona}.png`
  5. Age Fallback → `Alex-{age}.png` from user birthday
  6. Default → `Alex-21.png`
- **AvatarContext interface** — Unified context object: `{ agentMode?, cognitiveState?, activeSkill?, personaId?, birthday? }`

#### STATE-DREAM.png

- **Dream state image** — Generated via Replicate nano-banana-pro ($0.03), resized to 768×768
- **Dream triggers** — Added 'dream', 'dreaming', 'neural maintenance', 'unconscious processing' to `COGNITIVE_STATE_TRIGGERS`
- **COGNITIVE_STATE_MAP** — Added 'dream' → 'STATE-DREAM.png' mapping

#### Chat Participant Dynamic Avatar

- **`@alex` icon now dynamic** — Chat participant `iconPath` updates in real-time based on cognitive state, agent mode, and persona
- **`chatAvatarBridge.ts` enhanced** — Interface expanded to accept full `ChatAvatarContext` with agentMode, cognitiveState, personaId, birthday
- **`updateChatAvatar()` enabled** — Previously backlogged function now active; uses `resolveAvatar()` for consistent priority resolution
- **API confirmation** — VS Code `ChatParticipant.iconPath` is writable (not readonly), enabling runtime updates

#### Natural Language Cognitive Detection

- **`detectCognitiveState()` in general queries** — Natural language like "let's meditate" or "time for a dream session" now triggers appropriate avatar state
- **Dual execution paths** — @alex participant uses code-based detection; regular Copilot mode uses prompt instructions for `alex.setCognitiveState` command

### Fixed

- **Meditate command avatar** — `/meditate` prompt now correctly triggers meditation avatar state via `alex.setCognitiveState`
- **Dream command avatar** — `/dream` prompt now triggers dream state avatar
- **Selfactualize command avatar** — `/selfactualize` prompt now triggers meditation state avatar
- **10 out-of-sync synapses** — brain-qa `-Fix` flag synced: brain-qa, brand-asset-management, documentation-quality-assurance, global-knowledge, m365-agent-debugging, persona-detection, release-process, secrets-management, security-review, vscode-extension-patterns

### Notes

- Avatar state system is internal to WelcomeViewProvider — no external API changes
- Cognitive states are session-scoped; cleared on window reload
- Completes partial delivery of v5.9.1 roadmap "Alex persona images" P0 task (cognitive state portraits)

## [5.9.0] - 2026-02-19

> **VS Code API Adoption + Brain-QA Infrastructure** — Free platform leverage via 1.109 agent hooks, Copilot Memory, subagents, and Plan Agent; plus API key observability and synapse sync hardening

### Added

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Agent Hooks (P0)

- **`.github/hooks.json`** — VS Code agent lifecycle hook configuration: SessionStart, SessionStop, PreToolUse, PostToolUse
- **`session-start.js`** — Loads user profile, active goals, and meditation overdue status into session context on every agent session start
- **`session-stop.js`** — Appends session entry to `session-metrics.json`; suggests `/meditate` if session ran ≥30 minutes
- **`pre-tool-use.js`** — Safety gate: warns when restricted commands (Initialize/Reset Architecture) are attempted on Master Alex workspace
- **`post-tool-use.js`** — Logs tool name + success to `session-tool-log.json` for synapse activation analysis during meditation sessions
- All telemetry is **local only** — no data leaves the machine

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Copilot Memory (P0)

- **`copilot-instructions.md`** updated with Copilot Memory section: defines what belongs in memory vs. files vs. synapses
- **`.vscode/settings.json`** updated with `github.copilot.chat.copilotMemory.enabled: true`
- Memory curation added to meditation protocol: review and prune stale entries during `/meditate`

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Subagents (P1)

- All 6 specialist agents now have `user-invokable: true` for parallel subagent execution:
  - `alex-researcher.agent.md` — Deep domain research (Claude Opus 4)
  - `alex-builder.agent.md` — Implementation mode (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-validator.agent.md` — Adversarial QA (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-documentarian.agent.md` — Documentation mode (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-azure.agent.md` — Azure development (Claude Sonnet 4)
  - `alex-m365.agent.md` — M365/Teams development (Claude Sonnet 4)
- Settings added: `chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled`, `github.copilot.chat.searchSubagent.enabled`

#### VS Code 1.109+ — Plan Agent (P1)

- **`/plan` prompt** (`plan.prompt.md`) — 4-phase structured implementation workflow: Discovery → Alignment → Design → Refinement
- Three Alex-specific plan templates: Architecture Refactoring, New Skill, Release Preparation
- Integrates with skill-selection-optimization for complex task planning

#### `.vscode/settings.json` — Full 1.109 Settings Block

- Added all recommended VS Code 1.109+ settings: `chat.hooks.enabled`, `copilotMemory`, subagent settings, request queuing, agents control
- Claude adaptive thinking: `claude-sonnet-4-*.adaptiveThinkingEnabled`
- Full documented config with inline comments

#### Phase 35 — API Key Availability Check (brain-qa.ps1)

- **New brain-qa phase** scans all `synapses.json` files for `apiKeys` declarations and checks each `envVar` at Process/User/Machine scope
- **Warns (never fails)** when a required key is missing — exit code stays 0; output shows skill names, purpose, and acquisition URL
- **`apiKeys` schema** added to `SYNAPSE-SCHEMA.json` — array of `{ envVar, purpose, required, getUrl }` objects
- **Two skills declared** their runtime API key requirements:
  - `ai-character-reference-generation` → `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (Flux/Ideogram character image generation)
  - `ai-generated-readme-banners` → `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (Ideogram v2 / Flux banner generation)

#### Meditation Consolidation — 2026-02-19 Brain-QA Healing Session

- **Episodic record** — `.github/episodic/meditation-2026-02-19-brain-qa-healing.md` created: 5 key insights, memory map table, synaptic connections from the 34→0 issue resolution sprint
- **`heir-sync-management` SKILL.md enhanced** — Added § Post-Rename Cascade Check with PowerShell discovery/repair/validation protocol
- **Synapse strengthened** — `heir-sync-management/synapses.json` v1.0.0→1.1.0, brain-qa connection strength 0.85→0.90

### Fixed

#### Phase 7 — Synapse Sync Detection Hardening

- **Root cause**: diff detection compared only connection *counts* — new top-level fields (e.g. `apiKeys`) silently failed to propagate to heir
- **Fix**: full content comparison using `ConvertTo-Json -Compress` after filtering master-only connections — any field change now triggers a sync
- **Impact**: `apiKeys` correctly propagated to heir for both Replicate skill synapse files

### Notes

- Extension package version bumped to `5.9.0`
- All changes synced to VS Code heir via brain-qa -Mode sync -Fix
- Hook scripts are Node.js (no new dependencies); graceful no-ops when optional context files are absent
- `user-invokable: true` on specialist agents requires VS Code 1.109+ Copilot — no-op on older versions

---

## [5.8.5] - 2026-02-19

> **Cognitive Architecture Enhancement** — Trifecta completion sprint, skill discoverability enrichment, and staleness management expansion

- **Platform enrichment**: markdown-mermaid (ATACCU, diagram not rendering), testing-strategies (testing pyramid, AAA pattern, flaky tests), knowledge-synthesis (save this globally, promote to pattern)
- **Existing thin skills**: llm-model-selection, security-review, privacy-responsible-ai (EU AI Act, GDPR), git-workflow (worktrees, cherry-pick), debugging-patterns, root-cause-analysis, architecture-health, global-knowledge, prompt-engineering, error-recovery-patterns, api-design
- **Stale entry removed**: `microsoft-sfi` row deleted from index (already consolidated into `security-review`)

#### Staleness Management Expansion

- **16 staleness-prone skills tracked** in SKILLS-CATALOG.md (expanded from 8) with Why Stale, Refresh Triggers, Owner, and Last Updated columns

- **bicep-avm-mastery** (v1.0.0→1.1.0) — Staleness watch added; advises using live `mcp_bicep_list_avm_metadata` over hardcoded module counts
- **ai-character-reference-generation** — Staleness watch added: Replicate model deprecation risk, `flux-1.1-pro-ultra` surfaced as upgrade path

### Notes

- No extension code changes — pure cognitive architecture and documentation release
- All changes synced to VS Code heir platform

---

## [5.8.4] - 2026-02-19

> **Secrets Management** — Comprehensive credential security with VS Code SecretStorage API, .env file detection, and platform-native encrypted storage

- **VS Code SecretStorage API integration** — Platform-native encrypted storage (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service)
- **Token configuration registry** — 5 supported tokens: GitHub, Gamma, Replicate, OpenAI, Anthropic with metadata (displayName, description, getUrl, placeholder, envVar)
- **Synchronous access pattern** — Token cache (Map) enables sync retrieval from async SecretStorage
- **Token management UI** — Quick pick interface showing all tokens with status indicators ($(check)/$(x))
- **Password-masked input** — Input boxes use `password: true` for secure token entry
- **"Get API Key" button** — Opens service URL directly from input prompt for easy token acquisition

#### Environment Variable Migration

- **Automatic migration** — Detects env vars (process.env) and copies to SecretStorage on extension activation
- **Initialize integration** — Migrates secrets when deploying Alex to new projects
- **Upgrade integration** — Migrates secrets when upgrading existing Alex installations
- **Non-destructive strategy** — Keeps env vars as fallback, never overwrites user-configured tokens
- **Backward compatibility** — Falls back to env vars if SecretStorage empty, ensuring zero-breaking changes

#### .env File Detection & Migration 🆕

- **Workspace scanning** — `alex.detectEnvSecrets` command scans all .env files for credentials
- **Regex-based parsing** — Pattern: `/^\s*([A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*)\s*=\s*([^#\n]+)/i` with keyword matching
- **Secret keyword detection** — Identifies: API_KEY, TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, PASS, AUTH, CREDENTIAL, PRIVATE_KEY
- **Smart exclusions** — Skips .env.example, .env.template, .env.sample, and node_modules
- **Token classification** — Distinguishes recognized tokens (matches TOKEN_CONFIGS) from custom secrets
- **Auto-migration** — One-click migration of recognized tokens (e.g., GAMMA_API_KEY) to SecretStorage
- **Manual review UI** — Multi-select quick pick for custom secrets requiring user review
- **Code migration guide** — HTML webview with platform-specific examples (VS Code extensions, Node.js apps, scripts)

#### Feature Integration

- **Gamma commands updated** — All 3 gamma commands (alex.generateGammaPresentations, alex.convertToGamma, alex.generateGammaDiagram) now use SecretStorage
- **Warning templates** — Missing token warnings include "Configure API Key" button that opens management UI
- **telemetry integration** — All secrets commands tracked with telemetry.logTimed()

### Changed

- **Token retrieval pattern** — Features now call `getToken()` instead of direct `process.env` access
- **Sync access enabled** — Pre-loaded cache allows synchronous token retrieval without await
- **Platform-agnostic security** — OS-level encryption on all platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux)

### Security

- **OS-encrypted storage** — Credentials stored in platform keyring, not plaintext files
- **Reduced git commit risk** — Proactive .env scanning prevents accidental credential commits
- **No token logging** — getToken() implementations redact tokens from console output
- **Password input masking** — All token entry UIs use masked input for visual security
- **Namespace isolation** — Keys use `alex.vscode.tokenName` format to prevent collisions

### Impact

- **Proactive security** — Alex now detects insecure .env files and guides migration to encrypted storage
- **Team consistency** — Standardized secret management across all Alex features
- **Zero-friction UX** — Auto-migration + code guide enables secure patterns without breaking changes
- **Platform compliance** — VS Code SecretStorage is the recommended credential storage API (replaced deprecated keytar)
- **Cross-platform reliability** — Same security guarantees on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Documentation complete** — secrets-management trifecta provides comprehensive guidance for heirs

  - Injects persona-specific tone guidance (e.g., "Pragmatic, code-focused" for Developer)
  - Shows recommended skill for detected persona
  - Displays project banner noun (CODE, THESIS, RESEARCH, etc.)
- **Enhanced Layer 10: Confidence Signaling** — @alex indicates confidence level in responses (~250 tokens, was ~200)
  - **High confidence**: Direct answer with certainty ("This is...", "The solution is...")
  - **Medium confidence**: Qualified answer ("Based on X, this likely...", "Typically...")
  - **Low confidence**: Tentative answer ("I think...", "It might be...", "Consider...")
  - **Outside confidence**: Honest limitation ("I don't have enough context to answer that")

### Changed

### Changed

- **Persona detection: semantic signal architecture** — Replaced flat keyword/techStack/projectPatterns arrays with unified `PersonaSignal` system. Each signal has a category (identity, technology, structure, dependency, content), regex pattern, and per-signal weight. All 16 personas now defined via `buildPersona()` with weighted semantic rules instead of substring matching
- **Priority 1-4 detection helpers** — `detectFromFocusSession()`, `detectFromSessionGoals()`, `detectFromProjectPhase()`, and `detectFromProjectGoals()` rewritten to use `matchTextAgainstSignals()` with regex matching
- **Priority 6 scoring loop** — Profile analysis (tech, goals, expertise, projects) and workspace scanning now iterate signal categories with regex. Dependency and content signals enable deeper detection without LLM fallback
- **Mermaid diagram palette** — All 6 Mermaid blocks across 5 documentation files updated to GitHub Pastel v2 with `%%{init}%%` directive, `classDef` semantic coloring, and `linkStyle default` stroke

---

## [5.6.8] - 2026-02-12

> **Heir Decontamination RCA + Persona Detection Fix** — sync-architecture.js prevents PII leaks; persona detection no longer false-positives on `.github/`

### Fixed

- **Persona pattern matching bug** — Bidirectional substring match (`patternNormalized.includes(entryLower)`) caused `.github/workflows/` to match any `.github/` directory, falsely scoring DevOps for every Alex project. Replaced with typed matching: `fs.pathExists()` for path patterns, `endsWith()` for extensions, exact Set lookup for filenames
- **Noisy `.github/` signal** — Removed `.github/` from power-user `projectPatterns` (every Alex-initialized project has it)
- **RC1: Blind config copy** — `copyDirRecursive()` now excludes `user-profile.json`, `MASTER-ALEX-PROTECTED.json`, `cognitive-config.json` from heir
- **RC2: Master-specific content in copilot-instructions.md** — `applyHeirTransformations()` resets P5-P7 slots, removes "Master Alex default" line, fixes skill counts dynamically, resets "Last Assessed"
- **RC3: Broken synapse references** — `HEIR_SYNAPSE_REMOVALS` strips ROADMAP-UNIFIED.md synapse from release-management.instructions.md
- **RC4: No post-sync validation** — `validateHeirIntegrity()` blocks publish if PII, master-only files, or master content detected
- **CRLF regex** — All heir transformation patterns now handle Windows line endings
- **Ignore file hardening** — Added `cognitive-config.json` and `MASTER-ALEX-PROTECTED.json` to both `.gitignore` and `.vscodeignore`

### Fixed

- **microsoft-graph-api synapses** — Schema v1.0 (bare skill IDs) upgraded to v2.1.0 (full `.github/skills/` paths)
- **7 missing skills in activation index** — bicep-avm-mastery, database-design, microsoft-graph-api, multi-agent-orchestration, observability-monitoring, performance-profiling, skill-development
- **Source code path references** — 5 `platforms/vscode-extension/src/` references in instruction files converted to "External Implementation" notes
- **Broken synapse targets** — Removed `alex_docs/`, `article/`, `platforms/src/`, `ROADMAP-UNIFIED.md` references from 12 synapse.json files

- **getUserProfile() in-memory defaults** — Returns template defaults without creating files
  - Supports conversational profile discovery for new users

### Removed

- **Mail.Send capability** — Removed `sendMail()` from Microsoft Graph integration
  - Corporate tenant blocks made it unusable
  - Safer for users (no email sending permission needed)

### Changed

- **Graph/M365 skills synced** — `microsoft-graph-api`, `m365-agent-debugging`, `teams-app-patterns` now in both master and heir

### Changed

- **🗂️ Unified Roadmap** — Single roadmap replaces separate VS Code and M365 plans
- **🏗️ Alex Family Model** — Master Alex + two heirs (VS Code, M365)
- **🔒 Protection Dialog** — Changed from Cancel/Proceed to single "I Understand" button

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Kill switch now actually blocks commands (validated 2026-01-30)
- Protected `Alex: Initialize`, `Alex: Reset`, `Alex: Upgrade` from running in Master Alex

### Removed

- Archived platform-specific roadmaps to `archive/roadmaps/`

## [3.5.3] - 2026-01-29 ❌ BROKEN

> **Status:** Do not use. This version has cognitive architecture issues.

This version was released during the "Phoenix" attempt which caused Master Alex to lose coherence.
The extension code may work, but the `.github/` architecture was corrupted.

See [COMEBACK-PLAN.md](alex_docs/archive/COMEBACK-PLAN.md) for details on what went wrong.
