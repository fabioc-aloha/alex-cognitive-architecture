Alex maintains three types of memory:

### Synapses (Long-term)

Learned connections between concepts. Created when Alex discovers patterns or relationships.

- Stored in `.github/synapses/`
- Persist across sessions
- Strengthened through repeated use

### Episodic Memory (Session-based)

Records of significant sessions and decisions.

- Stored in `.github/episodic/`
- Captures key moments from conversations
- Used for context in future sessions

### User Memory (Copilot Chat)

Copilot Chat's memory about you, accessible to Alex.

- Cloud-synced across workspaces
- Contains preferences and patterns
- Managed via Mind tab or `@alex memory audit`
