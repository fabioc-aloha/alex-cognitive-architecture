**You own this data.** It's stored in readable files you can inspect, edit, or delete at any time.

## Data Processing

### Cloud Sync (Optional)

If you use cloud-synced AI-Memory:
- Knowledge files sync via **your own cloud storage** (OneDrive, iCloud, or Dropbox)
- You control the folder and its contents
- Alex reads/writes to the AI-Memory folder using your file system
- No additional accounts or services required

### Image Generation (Optional)

If you configure image generation:
- Prompts are sent to **Replicate** (your configured provider)
- Images are saved locally
- API keys stored encrypted via VS Code SecretStorage
- See [Replicate Privacy](https://replicate.com/privacy)

### GitHub Copilot

Alex extends GitHub Copilot. Copilot's privacy practices apply:
- See [GitHub Copilot Privacy](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-individual#privacy)

---

## Your Rights

### Access Your Data

All Alex data is in readable files:
- Open `.github/` folder in any project
- Open your `AI-Memory/` folder for global knowledge (cloud-synced via OneDrive/iCloud/Dropbox, or `~/.alex/AI-Memory/` local fallback)

### Delete Your Data

To remove all Alex data:

```bash
# Remove from current project
rm -rf .github/

# Remove AI-Memory (cloud-synced location varies by provider)
# Check your OneDrive/iCloud/Dropbox folder for AI-Memory/
# Or remove local fallback:
rm -rf ~/.alex/AI-Memory/

# Uninstall extension
code --uninstall-extension fabioc-aloha.alex-cognitive-architecture
```

### Export Your Data

Your data is already in portable markdown/JSON format. Simply copy the folders.

### Opt Out

- **Cloud Sync**: Falls back to local `~/.alex/AI-Memory/` if no cloud storage is detected
- **Image Generation**: Don't configure API keys
