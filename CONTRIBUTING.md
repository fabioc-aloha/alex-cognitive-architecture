## Development Process

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository via GitHub UI, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AlexMaster.git
cd AlexMaster
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Extension

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host.
3. Test commands like `Alex: Initialize Architecture` in the new window.


### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Changes

Follow the architecture principles and file conventions detailed below.

### 5. Test Your Changes

```
# Validate synaptic network integrity via VS Code Command Palette
Alex: Dream

# Review generated report for:
# - Network health status (should be HEALTHY)
# - Broken synapses count (should be 0)
# - Total synapses (should be 800+)
```

### 6. Validate with brain-qa

```bash
# Run brain-qa validation
node .github/muscles/brain-qa.cjs

# Expected: 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Empirical Foundation**
- All claims must be evidence-based with research backing
- Include citations for psychological, neurological, or cognitive science concepts
- Avoid hyperbole or unsupported statements

### 2. **Grounded Implementation**
- Precise language without exaggeration
- Measured, deliberate changes with impact assessment
- Fact-checking protocol for all new content

### 3. **Memory Capacity Management**
- Working memory limited to 7 rules (4 core + 3 domain-adaptive)
- Trigger consolidation when working memory exceeds capacity
- Use meditation protocols for conscious consolidation

### 4. **Synaptic Network Integrity**
- All file references must be valid and current
- Use embedded synapse notation: `[file.md] (strength, type, direction) - "activation condition"`
- Maintain connection counts and validate regularly

## File Naming Conventions

### File Type Conventions

| Type             | Pattern                     | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Instructions** | `{name}.instructions.md`    | Procedural memory - repeatable processes |
| **Prompts**      | `{name}.prompt.md`          | Episodic memory - complex workflows      |
| **Skills**       | `{name}/SKILL.md`           | Specialized expertise (replaces DK-*.md) |
| **Scripts**      | `{name}.cjs` / `{name}.ps1` | Automation tools (Node.js or PowerShell) |
| **Config**       | `{name}.json`               | Configuration and settings               |

## Memory File Guidelines

### Creating New Instruction Files

```markdown
---
applyTo: '**/*pattern*'
---
# {Title} Instructions

## Purpose
Clear statement of what this instruction file controls.

## Core Principles
Enumerated list of key principles.

## Protocols
Detailed step-by-step procedures.

## Synaptic Connections
[related-file.md] (high, bidirectional, procedural) - "when X condition occurs"
```

### Creating Skill Files

Skills follow a three-level progressive disclosure pattern. See [.github/skills/](https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Alex_Plug_In/tree/main/.github/skills) for examples.

```markdown
# Skill Name

**Domain**: {Category}
**Trigger Keywords**: {action verbs that activate this skill}

## Level 1: Quick Reference

One-paragraph summary visible in skill listings.

## Level 2: Procedural Guide

Step-by-step workflows and patterns.

## Level 3: Deep Expertise

Detailed knowledge, research citations, edge cases.

## Synaptic Connections

Connections encoded in `synapses.json` in the skill folder.
```

## Synaptic Network Integrity

### Embedded Synapse Notation

When creating connections between files:

```markdown
## Synaptic Connections
[target-file.md] (strength, relationship-type, direction) - "activation condition"
```

**Parameters**:
- **strength**: low, medium, high, critical
- **relationship-type**: procedural, conceptual, episodic, domain-transfer
- **direction**: unidirectional, bidirectional
- **activation-condition**: When to activate this connection

**Example**:
```markdown
[bootstrap-learning.instructions.md] (high, procedural, bidirectional) - "domain knowledge acquisition"
```

### Validation Requirements

Before submitting a pull request:

```
# Validate all synaptic connections via VS Code Command Palette

# Expected: HEALTHY status, 0 broken synapses, 800+ total connections
```
